<font color='#000' size='4'><b>A Misunderstood Legacy</b></font>
The Blagoona family began when a remarkable young Philimonjio man by the name of Blagoona Torquez ventured into the African continent across the sea. Blagoona Torquez began his reign of power after the establishment of the Holy Hierarchy in the African continent, and gave it the teachings of the Glaze. He began his worship with the Unenlightened Fucklets, those who lived in the East, but soon grew angry and distressed. The initial reasoning for this is yet unknown, but what is told in stories dating back to the beginning of Glaze and its formation, was that Torquez felt an immediate disconnection between his mind and the faith he was building upward.

<font color='#000' size='4'><b>Booby Blagoona - His faith, the people... and the beginning</b></font>
The Blagoona family was first recognized with Booby Blagoona (b. 1E, d. ?) in the last years of the First Era, a darkhided peasant from the far reaches of a Glazic discovery. What was unheard of by the Blagoona family, was that they were characters of great strength and ability. They looked for outreaches in their ways of guidance. They traveled very far and very boldly, and these characters of great ability, great mastery and great vigilance go on to tell their stories. These charismatic beings gave birth to a new age of reason and mindfulness among those they visited. These characters known as the Blagoonas came forth from an age of iron and steel, and threw themselves at the world for the world to see. There was no stopping Booby Blagoona, a man who rose to show the time of his age that he was up for the task of uniting, and so he did.

Booby himself rose from the times of chaos and destruction. The tribes from the Deadlands were in a conflict of civil war following their decimation at the hands of Lord Maximus. A time where they did not question otherwise why they would kill one another. Booby exposed to them a world unknown, and sought to unify these tribes folk.

Booby went from a child to a grown man with the hairs under the arms. He was a tall giant with a humble personality, but a nasty side of him that scorched the world. Not only that, but Booby Blagoona was a lot different from his forefather, the Torquez. He was no longer of Philimonjio blood, with an intact brain and heart that effortlessly visualized a victory over those who would jeopardize the alliance of the tribes. 

Much like others around him, he grew up where poverty was the only thing he knew. It was at one point as Blagoona grew old and as time went, that he wanted more out of his life, and so he grew from a small branch on the plant of solitude, to a man very talkative in nature and profound in speech. And what he did to further his education was read the relics of what was left behind after the embarkation of the African Continent many years ago in the First Era. He read on and on. It was said by many that it would be days before anyone would realize Booby was gone from his home in the community. He would sit by the river outside of society and soak in the information of literary mastery. Quitting was no longer part of Blagoona, so he continued and persevered to understand what these literary pieces meant to him.. He wanted to decipher what it all meant, and indeed he did.

It was a warm August morning when Blagoona made farewells to his people of inner Humanity. Family, friends, all alike were given the farewells of compassion and sympathy from him. He knew he had to move on with life, and so he did... very soon actually. It was only that evening on the same day that he departed for the greatness he always wanted, a new experience in life in the next journey he would come to. 

The next morning it was documented that his village was savagely destroyed by a nearby rival tribe... Booby would discover the abandonment of his home village many years after in the tale of his return to the African continent. Those who lived with him were either killed or enslaved and he would want revenge for it all. 

<font color='#000' size='4'><b>A Tale of Beauty Inside</b></font>
The tale goes that as the grand poet Booby Blagoona stepped onto the pedestal and gave forth his first speech, many years later, all eyes glistened and focused on the master at his finest. It was only then that everybody in the crowd felt his inner beauty, his majestic nature, his intelligence. The stars sparkled under the night of a man soaked in the passions of speech. He gave forth the words later deciphered by Hard-Glaze translators and literary geniuses associated. These words go as following:

<i>"I want the world to know, the peasants and darkhides, keep fighting, but know what you are fighting for in this world. I want you all to understand the embodiment of a man. It is I, Blagoona. Do not stop fighting may I say, but do know what you are fighting for in this world. Understand, comprehend the wars that go on in this world. As I firmly place my hand on my chest, and read out the scriptures, I want all to twinkle with vitality."</i>
-The Great Booby Blagoona, as he speaks with robustness on behalf of a 240,000 person parade in the Capital of Glaze itself and spectators of greater numbers. Lord Maximus tunes in on this gathering, watching from above in his bedroom window in envy.

Book_Booby_Page4 = [[
An uproar of Powderboys and Guardians scrambled to their feet and began a displacement in the capital's parade. It is said that during this change in behavior, noblemen and peasants together within the walls of the Capitol had gained a huge surge of rebellion in their hearts from Blagoona's speech, and had sent the entire city on a full lockdown status alert. Every door in the Garden of Glaze is put on full lock-down. Soldiers were struggling to stop the rioting as the city went into a full-fledged outbreak. Infrastructure destroyed, burnt to the ground. Even the royal escort vehicle was flipped upside down in the road and torched to a crisp by the rioters. All of this commotion only got worse when the Royal Palace was surrounded by a lynch mob of angry protesters, all wanting to kill Lord Maximus.

<font color='#000' size='4'><b>Esteemed Writer and Visionary</b></font>
Boxer Harvus Krammy (b. 3E d. 4E), was a Hard-Glazed author, humorist, philosopher, researcher, and Royal Senator. He is universally acclaimed for his works, including the world-famous The Perpetual Urges and its lost-to-time sequel, The Persistent Urges. Krammy, in his younger years as a Hard-Glazed researcher, contributed to the immensely valued and important research document, The Manifesto, which forever changed the way that the Phillimonjios viewed the Hard-Glazed system, as well as The Festering Bypass.

Though Krammy at the height of his career was among the richest men in all of the world, it soon came crashing down. Indeed, throughout his life Krammy was plagued by never-ending scandals. However, regardless of this, he was a man highly respected by those in the Royal Senate, including his enemies. Even Lord Maximus himself held Krammy as a dear friend. 

<font color='#000' size='4'><b>Early Life</b></font>
Not much is known of Krammy's early life, other than that he attended university District 1 and that his name appeared in many essays and research documents dating from the early years of the Third Era. It would appear that he was an esteemed researcher of the human mind, but soon decided to take up penmanship, writing many short stories and novels deeply rooted in Hard-Glazed culture.

<font color='#000' size='4'><b>Political Career and Fateful Duel</b></font>
Beginning in the last year of the Third Era, Krammy was suddenly instated by the Lord's decree to the office of Advisor to the Royal Senate. This appointment was a prestigious one, bringing with it the benefits and respect of noble life. However, it was revealed by an investigation shortly after Krammy's death that Krammy, despite his unusual rising within the upper echelons of Hard-Glazed society, had always despised the Royal Senate. Fragments from his diary state that Krammy thought the Royal Senate "prioritized morality" when it came to the lesser gene pool.

Indeed, during the turbulent times in the early years of the Fourth Era, the Royal Senate passed legislation that forbade the masters from striking their slaves for disobedience.

It is hotly debated to this day on whether or not this act was passed because the Royal Senate sympathized with the plight of their fellow man, or if they believed that the beatings hampered how much they could produce. Krammy also believed that the Royal Senate were "incompetent fools", and "corrupt as a manâ€™s mind after the sight of a lady". Krammy's suspicions were proven correct after the collapse of the Royal Senate, but Krammy never lived to see their punishment.

As Senatorial Advisor, Krammy had access to the entirety of the Royal Senate, and was present during all decision-making. He used his position to accomplish two main goals: undermining the Royal Senate and advancing his political career. His second goal was fulfilled when Krammy was appointed as an official Royal Senator upon the death of the leader of the National Faith Party. Krammy often obtained evidence of corruption from within the ranks of the Royal Senate, and then used this evidence to blackmail corrupt senators into doing his bidding. This made Krammy many enemies in the Royal Senate, and among them was the leader of the Royal Aristocratic Party, Thomas Edwards. The rivalry only worsened when Krammy was elected as leader of the National Faith Party, which was the most powerful party in the Royal Senate.
]]

Book_Boxer_Page3 = [[
Edwards' opposition to Krammy's ambitions eventually lead to a fierce rivalry between the two, where both men would openly denounce each other on the Royal Senate floor to the respective applause of their supporting parties and jeering by the other. Eventually, their rivalry would culminate in a famous duel in which both Edwards and Krammy were nearly killed. This incident left both of them recovering for months, and so both major political parties in the Royal Senate were without their leaders. Consequently, this left Krammy blameless for the Royal Senate's involvement in the emancipation scandal, a defining moment in Hard-Glazed history which separates the Third Era from the Fourth Era. However, some speculate that Krammy may have sown the seeds for the scandal in the first place, attempting to destroy the Royal Senate from within.

As a direct result of the Royal Senate's involvement, Lord Maximus crippled the power of the Royal Senate for good, including the dismissal of every Royal Senator and the establishment of the Small Council, with only a few of Lord Maximusâ€™ most trusted advisors remaining within the senate authority. Krammy, now powerless and without a source of income, returned to authorship.

<font color='#000' size='4'><b>The Perpetual Urges and Controversy</b></font>
Even as Krammy took up the mantle of Advisor to the Royal Senate, a laborious and strenuous job, he still continued to work on novels and stories for the masses. However, he was forced to abandon his pursuits in writing upon becoming an official Royal Senator, returning after being dismissed by Lord Maximus.

After the passing of the Fourth Erotica Ban (22) by the new Royal Senate, Krammy had decided that he'd "had enough with the Royal Senate's games". He sought to inspire the masses to revolt against the oligarchy and install a new senate in its place. It was during his time of peak suspicion and hatred of the Royal Senate that he completed his greatest masterpiece, The Perpetual Urges. It quickly became a bestseller, and is widely regarded to be the single most impactful work in all of Hard-Glazed history. Because of the success of The Perpetual Urges, Boxer H. Krammy became a household name. Yet, the vast audiences who had read Krammy's work had ignored the deeper message within, and Krammy soon found himself frustrated that the Royal Senate was still in power.

At the same time, many of the more conservative in the population were offended by the vulgarity and radical new concepts that it proposed. The Royal Senate knew that something had to be done about Krammy, and so began a master plan which would eventually lead to Krammy's fall from grace.
]]

Book_Boxer_Page5 = [[
<font color='#000' size='4'><b>Later Life and Execution</b></font>
The Royal Senate, joined by the obedient Small Council, chastised Krammy in the middle Fourth Era, citing the fact that The Perpetual Urges was a likely bypass to the Fourth Erotica Ban (22). Times were becoming more turbulent due to the rapid industrialization, and worker unrest was rising. The political and social backlash was immediate. Krammy was stripped of all honorary titles and his accounts were frozen. All of his works and originals were confiscated, though for some unknown reason his published works remained unbanned and available to the general public. Krammy retired to a log cabin deep in the outskirts of District 3. During this time he wrote poetry about the depressing smokestacks of the encroaching factories as more were built across the County Districts, and began work on a sequel to The Perpetual Urges, called The Persistent Urges. However, as his next great work was nearing completion, the Royal Senate took further action to impede Krammy. One night, while Krammy was visiting District 1 to recite poetry for Lord Maximus himself, unknown assailants burnt Krammy's cabin to the ground. Lost were many historical artifacts of utmost importance, as Krammy was a collector of antiquities. Some of the artifacts lost included items from the Old World, pre-dating the First Era. Additionally, while Krammy was in District 1, the Royal Senate stealthily organized riots against Krammy and The Perpetual Urges. In face of mass social unrest and a possible collapse of society, Lord Maximus had Krammy condemned to die by spooning. 

His last words were reportedly:
<i>"Once, I superfluously gave spokesmen like myself the rant of a lifetime. I will not let these boisterous baboons intrude on my work. Maybe because I'm kind hearted, but not for now will that happen in the eyes of the very Senate. We must ally with these fucklets, if we are to make way."</i>

The true meaning of these words remains unclear.

Book_County1 = [[
<font color='#000' size='4'><b>County Districts</b></font>
The 'County Districts' refer to the Glaze-owned territories along the border separating the Glaze and the Gore. These districts are typically of lower quality and are the only districts under control of the Ministers, and not the Small Council. Many consider these districts to not actually be part of the Hard-Glazed system, and are rather independent villages owned by peasants. 

Among the population of the County Districts include the retard, the darkhide, the savage, the pagan, the poor, the hungry, the fucked, the unenlightened, and the rejected of Philimonjio ancestry. For this, they are barred from the Central Districts and relegated to fucked living conditions hilariously out-matched by the pure perfection of the Central Districts.

Despite this, they remain of high population. Some Glazic scholars assume this is because of their high production efforts, with most factories and menial work relegated to the County Districtsâ€™ peasant population.

<font color='#000' size='4'><b>Discovery of the Gore</b></font>
Dating back to the dawn of the First Era, the â€˜Gay Goresâ€™ started off in a shroud of mystery. Originally thought to be a mad cult of northern folk, the Glazic nobility paid them little attention. Early serfs would report to their local Minister about 'mad mountain-men and spearfolk, white of skin' who would watch their villages at a distance. Rumors would spread among the County Districts which bordered between the Gore and Glaze.

It was not until the Second Era, in the aftermath of the Hierarchy wars, that the Royal Senate heard word of the Goreic Kingdom. It was said that a local county district's tradition was to send their village elders to the north, so that they would become one with the snow. For years they would send their elders into the cold winds of the north, and none would return. This changed when an elder returned from their quest with a 'ghastly look,' and a word of their findings in the Northlands. His findings were immediately reported to the Royal Senate, detailing a face-to-face meeting with these men, who called themselves 'the Gores' and spoke of false gods that were of anti-Glazic intent.

<font color='#000' size='4'><b>Goreic Kingdoms</b></font>
<i>"I suppose It'd be quite requisitory of the Royal Senate to enact a burdening response to these recent attacks on our peasant friends. To sit back, wait, and hope for a digression? Simply put, these Spearfolk must be swiftly cut down before they grow in number."</i>
-V.K Heimann - the 'Steel Tongue' of his days.

Around the late phase of the Second Era, beginning with the first encounter of the Gores at the Gay King Summit, Goreic raids have grown from legendary to quite common and then annoyingly frequent. From ambassador intelligence to captured Spearfolk, it was apparent that a great number of Goreic men were actually once of Glazic faith, and have converted over. Life among these people is extremely simple, their day consisting of crawling around in dark underground tunnels, or in cold villages on the mountains. Strangely, when asked what these men believe in, each response will vary. 

According to the beliefs of the Gores, a great set of deities rule over the world, known as the 'Family.' This family, consisting of two brothers, a sister, a mother, and a father, had created the world by 'finding the way.' The names of these deities never seem to be agreed on, but their roles seem unanimously known. The mother is the caretaker, the voice of reason. The father is the hunter, the seeker of nourishment for the family, but without the other members of the family to support him, he is nothing. The first brother is intelligent, but lacks communion. The second brother is of great communion, but lacks intelligence. The sister is the trickster, who causes troubles for the family, but will also help the family in time of need.

There is no noble class of these Gore people, but only a single faith system that guides them all. A series of schisms along the county districts have called for various purges to occur, but for every dead Gore another rises to take their place. Goreic activities have become widespread knowledge after the late Goreic Purges called by Minister Willtan that resulted in an absolute suppression of the Spearfolk militia. Despite our victories, it will indeed be a great struggle before these beast-men are completely removed from the light of Sol.

Millar C. Pance was a military tactician during thump and clash of the very well identified Holy Hierarchy Wars. A well deserved champion, however with troubling recurrences of almost dying in combat.

It was April 23rd, when two political heros and serious competitors of Goreic ancestry were prepared for quick execution, inside a primitive village isolation. Each perpetrator responsible for the genocide of an entire Glazic mining community. It was up to Millar to clean the residue left over after all campaigns in the northern Goreic-Glaze regions. So he arranged a date, and when that date came, he ordered his firing squad to load lethals and commence on the two prisoners of war.

<i>"They rose from the ashes of a terrible conflict and gave hope to the nation, but that was only the beginning..."</i> 
-Charles Simmons, Drill Sergeant under command of Gen. Millar C. Prance. Second man to witness the first encounter. April 23rd, II. 

There is no dispute in the empire that is powerful enough to reign hell on rayless beings of charcoal, a true land of gold, house of cultural diversity even when fucklets are crust, shit, or simply both. As always, the diversity allows for the fowls of evil to be admitted their blessings from The Glaze. It was the Gay Kings Men however, that stuttered the speech of noble spokesmen. Sabre clung men, the hardest of foul-mouthed raiders, to kill for coin. Soothe blanketed soldiers pledging an oath to unfair tactics. 

Even those Glazic souls, shortly trained and seasoned in the art of powder, had no bicker with such mystified ones. And a thick-skinned highness that held the imperial purse and emblematic family trophies, all in duel and humorless play in the fields; no match were any of these positions of those brandishing purity to the end of their days, which the Glaze would deem. 

As these homos of strangeness continued their discussed odyssey from uncharted estates, plagued by the Holy Hierarchy conflicts. Once places already of unconventional government and oddball customs, it was a no-brainer to many, that these mystified beings would come from the nuisances of the world, and challenge a superpower of the world.

They looked to find refuge, worse in a triumphant nation at best, but who is to say the coin is not turned to reveal the Glazic people and their looking for salvation. Only one would hope not, for the Glaze is all they knew, and hopes to only know when darkness shrouded the world, as history tends to repeat itself.

The strangers received zero backlash, as the country itself was hanging on the balance, with a war in the closing, and the leftover destruction unimaginable. So when these interesting beings arrived, making their first appearances in autonomous regions bordering Goeric mountains, it was no wonder that all banded together and greeted these fascinating ones. Those who would seem to magically morph from thin air into the many neighboring treelines, walking endlessly from wherever they came from through enormous plains.

<font color='#000' size='4'><b>Immortal Awakenings (A Child Abduction)</b></font>
A terrible scheme of backstabbing had surfaced after six months from when the powerful beings was discovered, in one of outlying Goeric-Glaze autonomous regions, known for the first sightings of travelers by the Hard-Glaze commander. The story so goes, that a young boy onwards to becoming an apprentice hunter, only at the time coming of age, had traveled with his grand father deep into the forests almost bordering the mysterious Goeric lands. This boy was innocent, and never thought much of what he was doing. He was going by what his grand father had instructed him to do, both of them originally together on a pleasant hunting trip. It was until the boy was specifically told by the wiser man to go fetch five items of the land, that something had happened. It was told in order as is. 

<i>"Child do as I say.. recite the words three times after me. I acquire these five things." 
And so the child listened attentively, eyes wide awake. 
"One Portobello Mushroom from the largest of ancestors oak tree." 
"One picking of Microsorum Pteropus, three leaves each." 
"One Dryopteris Filix-Mas, one single leaf." 
"One slice of wet bark from last nights sprinkle, found on a oak tree of our ancestors." 
"And finally one handful of the purest red berries, careful not to be poisonous."</i>

The boys grand father told the boy to open his hand, where the man gently placed a cold dagger in, and slowly had the boy close his clutch around it protectively. He also put his very own leather satchel on the boys frail body, over his small shoulders, and kissed the boy on his forehead before sending him on his way. 

As the boy marched hesitantly into uncharted territory that became increasingly dark and moist, the elder shouted through the trees for him:
]]

Book_Gay_Page5 = [[
"Child, remember the five things I require, and return for supper and you will make me a happy man. I have faith in you!" 

The boy yelled "Yes pappa!" before continuing onwards into the void. 

It was two hours into the wilderness that the boy had found himself confused and lost, unable to retrace his steps as told times before, and the little one finally had found himself slumped up against a tree with none of the five things anywhere in sight. The boy felt himself falling asleep, exhausted from the long voyage, and had awakened to the sounds of night owls, crickets, and russling in the nearby bushes. He had lost track of time and clearly disobeyed his elders instruction to return at supper. 

As the boy gathered himself and prepared to try and find his way back home, he couldn't help but notice out of the corner of his eye, a white glimmer that stood out in the darkness, strangely grabbing the younglings attention. 

The boy decided to follow the glimmering orb in the world without light, and it had felt like an endless tunnel he walked through, each step growing the orb larger and larger. The boy continued towards the orb until the glimmer had suddenly shifted into a dramatic beam that shot out in his face like a sword, blinding the child enough for him to have to squint hard. 

Gradually as the light engulfed the childs entire perspective, his vision recovered as well, allowing him to witness a world that appeared to mimic a place that put the greatest Hard-Glaze wonders to shame. Those being artificial and nothing more, and this seeming more real than anything ever witnessed. 
]]

Book_Gay_Page6 = [[
In the boys underdeveloped mind, he had perceived this incredible sight as the Light itself, but was still unsure what it actually was. The belief of it being The Light however, was remarkably a reasonably agreed concept embedded in Hard-Glaze society at the time.

The child, at that moment, thought what he was witnessing was some strange fever that triggered an onset hallucination, perhaps from a form of poison ivy he sat in when falling asleep in the forest. But there was no evidence of iritation or markings on his skin, checking himself furiously. It was a strange phenomenon the boy could not explain, and as happening he felt more compelled to discover what it could all mean. 

Time had seemed to cease, as the brightness toned easier on the eyes, allowing for the little one to see the captivating dreamscape. It was the recognisable Capitol District and the typical outskirts, but suddenly the powerful light emerged again for a brief minute, before fading one final time. 

At this point a thick haze had taken the place of the overwhelming light, directly overlapping the cityscape that was seen only moments ago. The Capitol Districtâ€™s current design then transformed after leftover haze into something only envisioned by the greatest intellectuals Lord Maximus could muster up in society. The city now standing as a miraculous showpiece beyond any one persons comprehension, a positive vision of the future. 

All of society had shifted into the brightest future in the blink of the kids eyes, in a state that presented itself best described as silver and gold surfacings everywhere the iris could saturate. A rich society that allowed elegance without baggage. The infrastructure notorious, with colossal skyscapers, towering over streets and overpasses, all materialized into very intelligible design to show a still triumphant society, this time revived to its former glory. Other things were witnessed afar.

Objects, very sophisticated in design, somehow suspended miles in the air. These were the first spaceships, sharing the skies with other vehicles, before the erupting with powerful boosters that put the fastest stallions to shame. Beams of energy shooting directly in the air, many of these energy pockets situated all over the place, any areas one could not even conceivably think, across the skyline forming colorful spires through the clouds piercing the atmosphere above. 

The land was fresh and cleansed of chemicals and pollutions left after a terrible war. A land showered sweet from sorrow and chaos that plagued the people of its time. It was the most beautiful thing one person could witness, and a simpleton kid who found it through a light, had been stunted, frozen in his place completely, absorbing everything at once. 

The child watched as little ants moved across the skyline, the land timelapsing into morning, evening, night, and repeat.. People in their daily lives. Society in motion, as the beauty seemed to continue endlessly like a simulation, the shining imagery then began to quickly dim into darkness, and the eyes of the child shielded once again.. he blinked, realizing what now was in front of him. Something wasn't right here at all. 

<font color='#000' size='4'><b>The Mass Mobilization (The Rising)</b></font>
After five back to back days of fear and anguish in the local community the boy resided in, the regional governor had received word of the tragedy, and under the pressures of the entire populace the man delivered a notion of action. He spited every fucker peasant deterring him from finishing a mediocre meat platter that tasted as dry as disgusting old peasant nibble.

But in his eyes the best thing yet. This royal pig fake having never visited the Capitol District at all. With all of the governments coffers for a piss-poor autonomous region in bankruptcy, this unsavory man had an angry fit from being kept from finishing his plate. But it was before coming to his senses about the rumored lost child, that he quickly made a change in heart and stamped the official paperwork with a red seal, and that a search party was legally underway.

So as required, a semi-efficient militia troop was assembled from the barracks, but it was the slowest most undisciplined fighting force, many of these men a coarse type, but admired for their rugged backgrounds of toughness at least. However these men were corrupt type at large, and seen as uncivilized and a world apart from the nobles residing outside of these counties. The troop itself was also struggling, but at least they had weapons to use.

The marksmen brandished longbows with limited arrows, and the rest of the troop carried variations of spears and the dullest warblades decades old, and only a select few actually held onto a somewhat impressive gunpowder piece passed down from unimpressive legacy holders. It was the most this fighting force could build up, as the outlying counties were hit the hardest in the wake of Holy Hierarchy Wars, where all resources had suddenly vanished. 

The two men identified carrying such guns was the Governor himself, having noone reliable and trustworthy enough to command a fighting force in the fields. At his side nothing more than an ignorant, blatantly clueless weakling. His very own stepson. The imbecile thought once as being retarded. The governor was like many county rulers at the time however, trapped in poverty and accustomed to dirty work that placed him almost on a level to his own serfs. But it was his stupid stepson given the powers to inherit the pathetic bankruptcy incase death struck swift, because honestly who cared.

So the army was mobilizing with what dwindling troops it could encourage, and a few somewhat decent officers were told to sprint to nearby townships and villages and knock on every door to a home, and stir the pot. Efforts to claim additional numbers to find the boy were met with resistance, and these dimwitted officers were being inefficient in everything they did, not to even say professional in the slightest. 

It was dark already, and people settling inside for the night were awakened by the loudest knocking and shouting of orders. As clear as the moon, this was no ordinary search party it seemed, as a child going missing was something people never thought would happen in communities where lessons were taught the hard way, and Goeric-Glaze ideas intermingled and gave false impressions to keep children from being naughty, or stupid in the forests adults would not go. 

As the news of a search party continued, the ragtag soldiers flashed a small artists interpretation of the boy, the shittiest inaccurate picture from the Governors worst painter. These pictures were shoved aggressively in peoples faces, and if unable to answer the simplest question of who this boy was, the scumbags in power would chop open throats/loot bread/move to the next. Everybody around the small region knew what the kid looked like however, given these were small family communities where people knew if the Governor was sleeping around with several of the villagers wives, when the husbands were working hard in the mines all day. 

The entire village square was trashed and littered, with enraged villagers storming back to their homes to gather up the weapons. Women and children seeked shelter, and only the faintest of heart in these categories decided to follow the masses. It was witnessed that the mothers would drag their crying infants by their arms to safety, but the fathers being so crazed would knock around everywhere, like drunkards and step over the fallen younglings. Others were summoned to watch.

The commutal center was lit like an inferno of fire, but the rest of the streets and areas were pitchblack. Quickly more and more villagers assembled with pitchforks and farm equipment, all bluntforce objects it seemed, and those who questioned such overreacting peoples were put on a blacklist for later wrist slashing. All of the wisest elders were forced into the commutal gathering, and told to present clues into the whole mess. It was until the oldest of the elders had spoke out and silenced the entire rabble, that everybody stormed out of the gates with their lanterns and their murdering tools. 

"It's the fucking ol' dark hide that kidnapped that poor child! The only one who lives here!" 

The lynchmob fought through the gates, and smaller search parties were starting to construct once outside. The Governor had only then arrived to witnessed what he had intentionally started earlier, ontop of a black steed with metal plates covering its eyes, armed to the teeth.

Travel gear mixed in with military grade hardware, all the necessary killing parts like spare swords and lengths of rope for hanging fucklets, bundled up into pockets hanging from the side of the horse. But all of the war parts seemed mundane in comparison to the decapitated head of a Goeric criminal, skewered ferociously on a mount sitting above the saddle like a flag.

The more agile boys able to weld a weapon were sent out to light bonfires in random places across the dark field opening, and as these fires lit ablaze massively, they started to attract more and more people across the lands. These were beacons of an emergency. The devoutly religious and fanatic would serve the Governor and fuel his cause, and end up traveling oceans of geography to finally organize along with the others. This whole commotion was no ordinary lynchmob assembling, but a historic milestone, and there would be an endless surplus of warm bodies in for sweet revenge. 

The fire piles were gigantic, and were only said to have been used once in a blue moon. As burning fuels smokestacked the starry night, strange foreign noises would erupt over all the chaotic people every several minutes. These being indicators that a new party had just arrived. Each horn had a distinct echo that represented the Goeric family and tradition. The new arrivals would start off as a small group, but it would end up being atleast thirty minutes or more, before an estimated five hundred bloodthirsty motherfuckers had marched out into the grassy plain opening to greet the governor. 

Eye witnesses reported that the governor exchanged handshakes and Goeric prayers, before opening a pouch and dropping precious gems in each leaders hands.

"It was all so strange to see a Glaze-Born elite issuing pleasantries to a widely misunderstood peoples, and both societies cooperating in the midst of a crisis." 
"Our Glazic Union carried the weight of fifty lifetimes of bloodshed on the Goeric peoples, and yet these gifts had charmed such selfish brutal peoples." 
-Elmer Roskimer, Glazic minuteman of the militias 41st Sword & Slingers, and eye witness account during the arrival of Goeric Warbands from the north. 

<font color='#000' size='4'><b>A Goeric-Glaze Dispute</b></font>
The Goeric re-enforcements had arrived at request, and the governor had gold coins in his eyes. He dismounted to salute the toughest Gore chieftains he could find in the outback, and these warriors stood still with unreadable expressions, as they expected something "more serious." These warriors looked as if they were living in caves for a milinium. Giant muscular males with the longest unkempt beards ever seen. 

These guys put the governors toughest militia to pity, and the meatiest man alive in rank stepped aside as the Goerics entered the governor's caravan. It was all a true sign of an overreaction on the Governorâ€™s part, and now he had to pay the price for it. Over a fucking child lost. 

All Gore regulars carried the similar, but it was the three distinct big guys that held the prize. These commanders known for nasty guerilla tactics had salvaged armor likely from corpsed army generals of the past. They carried a combination of priced artifacts passed down from warchief to warchief, all stemming old Goeric-Glaze conflicts that raged their homelands, and yet they were speaking with a considered enemy.

The governor had no quarrel with these men, they'd rip his fucking face off in a heartbeat. So he bowed servitude to THEM, and kneeled very presentable infront with one foot supported like a jester. Somewhat ashamed about all of this, and feeling he was embarassing his army, he cracked a sarcastic smile as if it was all some kind of joke. Typical enough, these Goeric generals had seen it all, and were unphased by his pathetic princess gesture, and some failed to even notice the bow. Now they only looked at the idiocy going on around them. 

The governor stood up, and the biggest of all Gore chieftains made a grumbling sound with his mouth, chomping on a straw of hay and looking ahead like deep in thought. His name was Glaymore Bumbostomp, and his title gave light on what he loved doing - stomping skulls to cheddar. Bumbostomp finally crossed eyes with the now profusely sweating Glaze governor, and started to reach into his very own personal bag. From there he very intentionally pulled out a very large object from the flap, as slow as humanly possible. Stomp had to place it on both hands at once, it being that heavy, and when the Governor finally understood, all he could do was cry. 
<font color='#222' size='12'><b><i>"Spite the fools!"</i></b></font>
- The words of famous governor Alexander Pantis, as he urged his bodyguards to attack the Goeric giants.

It was a destroyed skull, only parts of the jaw still remaining, and Bumbostomp was unsatisfactory about the gem tributes given to him and his other friends. He wanted something else, and it was annexation of the township, the full region, and all neighboring farms and assets available. He also ordered for the governor to give up rights to the castle estate already falling into disrepair.

Book_Gay_Page14 = [[
If unable to comply, the Goreic hordes would besiege the township and torch every living and non living thing, and plague the land with an immersurable quantity of illnesses, aswell as make the governors domain a hotspot for fielding armies to penetrate Hard Glaze soil. Essentially Bumblestomp was a visionary, and wanted to obtain ownership. Bumbostomp also promised that all surviving peoples of the land would be converted to the Goeric belief system, and promised a surplus of partners and riches in return. 

Right away the chaos had tripled and the governors bodyguards ran to his aid, unsheathing fancy swords. The governor begged the Gores with one fundemental question, as dozens of his security forces jumped into position to attack.

"Why is THIS land of value to you, kind sir?" 

Bumblestomps size made the governor pathetic, and Bumble motioned for a henchman to slowly lay down an antique suitcase. First the Gore held up a hand in the most lethargic way, and the bodyguards all reacted quickly to the motion, running backwards an estimated seven feet. The three giants not moving a muscle. The governmental security however, acting like loyal mutts, soon enclosed again with persistence. "Open it, fool." hollered Bumble, and the Glazeman made a whimpering sound that some of his men grimaced to.

The governor continued the follow none the less, and cautiously lifted up the lid. A person popped out fast wearing a brightly striped colored jumpsuit and cone hat -- Bumbles dwarf son, now laughing in a high pitched schizoid voice. One or two of the governors armed henchmen threw up their buckler shields tighter, as the little fuck appeared out of the small space. Just when things couldn't get worse, the governor's timid state was overthrown by a sensation of pure hatred and disgust. Right in the heat of the moment, he inched forward closest to the ugly ass midget, until he could see a nasty infected bump on its bottom lip. 

Spectators reported that the governor threw the hardest suckerpunch imaginable in the little shitâ€™s face. The midget fell backwards in a bloody mess, bringing with him the suitcase, but the tiny jokester continued to laugh hysterically with a broken nose, squirming around like a worm. The midget and the suitcase collided with Bumblestomâ€™s legs, and everything at that moment busted out of control. People started dying at an alarming rate. 

"The guards were using gentlemens fairness the first matter of seconds, but as men looked around at their best friends being lifted in the air and chucked, these troopers came to their senses, realizing they would not win this fight like that.." 

The three huge Gores having no time to waste, started plowing into everything without warning. The governor slipped away and screamed a deafening three words: 

"Spite the fools!"

His shieldbearers created a sloppy testudo wall to cover him, while men from each wing did hit and run maneuvers. The giant fuckheads started ripping through the caravans wagons and supplies. Men were being thrown ridiculously high like ragdolls, and the very best Glaze Guards were butchered most violently until unrecognisable. Not a single Gore harmed, because these were the spoils of war, and the Gores knew it. So they continued to trash every element until blood ran deep in the lands heritage. The Governor managed to slip away untouched, but all of his best troops had been torn apart, limb from limb like the dumbest creatures. These Gores were known for inhumane treatment, and did not give the men a fighting chance. 

"Men are running in all directions, dropping their arms and fleeing. Some have discharged their powder shots but the balls are flying into a forest. I'm seeing advances two-fold. The enemy is advancing two-fold, and the Governor's convoy has been demolished. The township is under attack, and our allies have deserted us."

The township was seen for miles over pinetrees, engulfed in a maroon smoke. The governor managing to escape the undergoing mayhem, had barely outrun Goeric pursuers on foot to a nearby horse stable. There, he rode the last remaining steed to his fortified castle estate. 

The army was in shambles, men dragging their fallen peoples across the battlefield. Some made it outside the boundary, but found themselves being attacked by bandits. 

As the district leader galloped to the crossroads of a once blossoming fishing commute, he had witnessed uninterrupted evil. The despairs of great peoples known for heroism, triumph over evil, perseverance, and the continuity of nobility -- A bloodline preserved for generations, and traced back to the even the first settlers. Now it was all gone, and this man was the reason for it. A stupid lord who inherited too much. 

He was the audience of such evils, nobody cared at all.

When returning days later, he was struck immensely. An almost surreal sight. Religious centers had been long since blackened by fires that occured. Chapels, safe havens for everybody, used for sadistic killings. Manufacturing districts exploded from the inside out, all workers of these operations incinerated in seconds.
 
Departing from the ghostly place, he became aware of the Gay Gore, and how they stomped the seat of power. The magistrate had windows busted out, and gunpowder residue: the proof of what happened. Tiny holes, at least fifty or more, had penetrated the front doors like a cheese grater . These motherfuckers used grapeshot on the Mayor. 

It was pouring down now and the lord's tears were hidden through the rain. He could not sustain, all emotion almost drained, making him colder and more vengeful. 

Why? Why were these spoils of war allowed? Did these Gores have no discipline? Why did they do this? It was too late to wonder, action was now needed. 

The Gores were unshy of letting corpsed fucklets marinate the slop dirt. The highness had to ride over a barricade of bodies in a military checkpoint. Loads of impaled suckers too, to rot wastefully in the weather. 

When riding out of the dead commute he had discovered masses of the peasants, marching their own little make-believe armies out of the town. 

"Ahh, so the dark hide is working evils with the Gore...." 

These were the peasant infidels deemed forever imprisonment. Now these workers waved a Goeric flag that was modified for a false idol! So the man atop his horse looked a gaze like daggers, scrutinizing these whoresons in motion.

He was greeted by hundreds of surviving men congregating outside a swampy moat. The drawbridge was lifted up to keep their own men from entering the facility. It was only an hour and a half into the battle and men were retreating to their last line of defense. Troopers were heard in agony, doctors hastily working in tents to patch up the wounded, and those unable to be saved quickly shoved into makeshift graves that dug up the outer perimeter. Some were thrown in large craters with dozens of others on top, a mixture of dead and alive, many assumed already gone. Upon seeing the governor arrive on horseback, many of these defeated men gave an exhausted cheer. The lord bestowing a tired gesture himself, and numerous souls continued working at a snails pace with shovels. There were plenty of dead sons to bury in the earth. 

It was dark and the governor shouted from below for the defiant sentries to drop the bridge. Finally they complied, only after the governor ordered his men to begin torching his stronghold. The governor had little energy left.

The revolting serfs had now just returned, armed with the blacksmiths creations, and the blacksmith himself tied in a sack. Men were still trying to get inside, being showered left and right by arrows and rocks. They put almost no effort to get in, men falling off the sides of the bridge into the murky depths and drowning. The ocassional powder shot was fired from the mob, missing, but it was loud enough to demoralize. 

Many souls lives were now in the hands of peasantry, as the rebelling serfs were making great strides, the lord having no choice but to leave family to die. As the drawbridge struggled to be raised, the last thing heard was the voice of a soldier, almost inside but crippled. He was only a boy.

"Put the boy down so he may live a better life!" 

People argued what to do, some of the relatives panicking to try and save the kid from dying. Knights lined up to push them back, before the lord had enough and screamed for captain to play the bugle. More were called to help.

A line of pikemen formed at the entrance to slow the advancement, a priest now giving the blessing fast. The mother with her back turned, sobbing. Women were also shielding their younglings from seeing the horrors, the father of the boy the only relative allowed to watch. He clutched his hands like fists, a straight face the entire time. His father knew his child would die, so the man was strong. Silent as he looked his boy in the eyes. 

"Lest us remember you, champion! And lest us remember Hard-Glaze. The divine shall lift you...." 

The remaining observed as the pikes pulled back, and the gates came crashing down. The father of the boy continued to look at his dying son until he could not. Suddenly there was the sound of a crossbow bolt released, and a gurgling sound replacing horrifying shrieks. The father was relieved of all worry, shutting his eyes. The final siege had only just begun.

Governor Pantis had no objection for a well planned last standing, so he ordered the big boys to kill all reserves from inside with hands, knowing it could falter the advance of a siege for several more days, and keep good blades from becoming bad blades. These defenses would hold good, but starvation was a concern, even for inexperienced powerholders. So Pantis demanded something seeming foolish at first, but in his eyes a fury vengeance to wreck sick humanity. 

Two scouts were dismissed from tedious labor inside the fortress, to perform more tedious labor outside the fortress. It was when these two men with speed had acquired more than a scenic overview of corpsed fucklets scattered in outlying ruins, that they ran a even harder one back to inform Pantis of a new upcoming razing. 

They were in view of the fortress, and right outside the drawbridge were two tired war steeds galloped into view. These beasts with them had the bodies of nude men, attached to the sattles by their broken limbs. Their pale counterpart glazemen had fleshtones impure with a sickening shit flavor, like mud.

In other words, these men tied to steed, they were covered on a disgusting shit that caked their bodies in the hot sun. Surprisingly they survived the journey without eating the shit, and then puking their guts out violently. 

The two scouts slowed in the grazing field to meet the duel steeds now coming into view, but they continued past, all the way to the water defense where these exhausted beasts sipped the murky fluids, given they would soon die of dehydration from the run.

Pantis sat indoors as this happened, but the trumpets were played from man to man, from the farthest side of the stronghold, to the doors of the Keep. The governor was mapping out the base with his leftover officers, when a knight rushed through the doors unannounced. 

"Two men are here. Survivors." 

"They bring forth words of grace? Or words of disgrace?" 

"Words to kill our race..." 

"Then we bring our boys home, then spite these fools without taste once they besiege our last line." 

"Aye sir!" 

The quartermaster ordered five rambunctious loyal ones to walk out into the forest as intended decoy, aside with the corpsed animals dotted in the wilderness. The armies were now in view of the Lord in the tower, but he thought it would be a couple hours before arrival. Pantis could feel the shaking of drum and cannon combined. The defenses were not set just yet, as Pantis thought they had time, but it was clear as day he was wrong.

Right as the men entered the deep treeline and almost were lost, there was the sound of crashing over all the battles in the distance, and the area they marched into was instantly engulfed by a white smoke. Horses on the patty fields were startled by the rupture, and started going crazy. Bugles played without the Lord's given word, every man now witnessing the ordeal. Archers started to run to the walls, climbed ladders up, or took the stairs, where they were preparing their remaining missiles. Lines of men running up where they could, in surprising formation. But was it enough? 

Guns were carried slower up the walls, but they managed. The archers followed up behind a shorter line of gunners by the two left and right defenses, where the bridge sat in between below. These bowmen and repeaters aiming in the sky. The powdershot troopers either using sticks to line up shaky hold, or leaning up against the wall itself with their guns. 

It was then that smoke had begun to sweep through the forests opening, all the way out to the drawbridge an incredible length. The five brave ones were evidently sucked into the trap. "Damn that Bumblestomp!" Governor Pantis screamed ferociously, and all were then heard distinctly in the forest, screaming as they died, the cannons firing. Pantis was furious, with all of his tricks foiled by a smarter Bumblestomp out of nowhere. The corpsed animals did not deter starving peasants, as he would realize. 

A soldier skipped steps to the tower where Pantis overlooked in awe. 

"Sir! They're here. They're here! You said it'd be a couple hours until!" 

"Clear as day private, so defend your peoples or witness death! I miscalculated."

"Damn straight!" 

Dozens of sillouttes then showed in the opening, as the closest cloud of smoke dissipated inches by the fort. Of course the lesser souls of peasant status like fodder were sent first. Promised fine coin and ample stomachs full. They started to accumulate in a mass, now an estimated two hundred. They seemed to hesitate after leaving the fortâ€™s protection, but a horn sent them into a frenzy towards the forest with pitchforks, some with shorter blades, some with nothing at all. The commanders gave a hand signal on the walls, standing on chairs behind. A drum riff made clear, and the voices mostly similar. "Loose." 

Arrows answered scum, and every skipped archer behind was told to shoot one missile so they could conserve ammo. Some peasants in their farmers outfits, suspenders, as well as cowboy hats had begun to collapse in the front as they charged. These defenders continued routine two more volleys until the senior officer yelled to the other walls through a cone, standing behind his marksmen on a highstool. "Their general is in the back!" 

Troopers acknowledged this sentiment, and the archers were told to aim lower to reach the Gay leader. More volleys ensued, and finally the mob was wiped out and the stragglers running for their lives. The Goreic master dead under his own in the field. 

A second smoke appeared far off to the right, the mens celebrations died down. 

"It's not over..."

Muskets quickly angled to the source in their positions. The cloud remained longer this time, a group of four seen coming out to entertain the attack. 

"That's all?" 

They appeared weak, in civilian outfits, but this time they were smarter, all four men brandishing large serpentines, fearlessly aiming barrels ahead, before blasting fireballs in the defenders positions. Semi-automatic in clear synchronization. Long streams of fire carried bombs over in response, all guns going off louder than any Bronze Glaze siege shot. Fast like bullets, one of the bombs landed spot on, creating a spectacular display of pink mist and dirt pick up, killing useful muskets. One bomb landing short outside, and the last one slamming into the side of a wall, shaking the foundations center. 

Men were told not to fire their guns, but several violated and spent their precious balls in panic. One senior officer fell off his stool nearby, a quake knocking him down. Enraged and sweating profusely, he got back up, torn ceremonial cloth, and limped over to beat the stupids with the steel on a pistol, first firing his only round point-blank in a traitors kneecap. The fools had never seen their master swear so much in life, and being shot was a 'no go,' so they sharpened up and stopped wasting their missiles. They hit nothing when firing their powder, the four cannon boys already running back into their smokescreen with heavy contraptions.

For one to be spooned, you must remove their clothing and firmly strap them into your position of choosing. The victim will be slouched downward, revealing the depths. You must stuff said spoon into the victims chocolate inventory, removing all of its contents. Start by penetrating through the rim, inserting an opposite route, then plunging it deep further. Once you scoop out a creamy, sticky substance, start scooping slower to increase pain. Continue scooping until the 'canal' is fully breached, then sit back, and enjoy the sights of the victim being drained.

The Ride of Tears is among the most shameful ways to die in the Hard-Glazed society, more-so than spooning. Those executed on the Ride of Tears are normally murderers. Indeed, similar to spooning, those executed on the Ride of Tears lose all hierarchical status and all their heirs are nullified if they are of formerly noble stature. 

<font color='#000' size='4'><b>The Contraption</b></font>
The Ride of Tears consists of an extra-tall water-slide, standing at approximately twenty-five feet tall. It is three feet wide and about thirty feet long. The water-slide, however, is filled to the brim with razorblades and other sharp blades, beginning at about the four-foot mark on the way down. Those condemned to die have their hands tied, are blindfolded, drenched with honey to lubricate them, and forced down the slide by two powderboys, each armed with a pike. If the condemned is still alive by the time he reaches the bottom, at which point he will have likely lost several limbs and all of the skin on his back, several nearby beekeepers will let their bees loose upon him, to feast upon the honey and his flesh. After the condemned is expired, they are transported to the Iron Gate of Glaze to be displayed outside, for the doors have not opened in centuries.

Black and drifting aimlessly as locked in port, these ferocious warriors above their Death Ships go by the common nickname of the Blagoonie Sailor Sweets.

God bless his nasty soul. These whaling ships are guarded by some of the most elite protection leagues under Hard-Glaze legislature and authorities.

"Ahoy, we've made it alas!" -- Lord Maximus' first words of rejoice, as he and his superior officers made landfall onto the coast of Madagascar. "Alas, bring me two men to the crows nest, and prepare me a meal from the galley..." But soon enough, the entire fleet in its formation encountered a rather intimidating foe around the rocky cliffs of the coast. It was a darkhide pirate vessel, and beyond that, many more of them in a line, swiftly maneuvering into the direction of the setting sun so that they could aim starboard side their smaller barrel cannons at the Hard-Glaze armada, as it clearly lacked the readiness to dispense ammunitions back if to be attacked by the fleet, moving in a forward line. The top officer, below the stature of Lord Maximus, ordered a sailor man to ride the bowsprit of the boat, and gaze his binoculars in direction to the incoming fleet that would be turning its guns in direction of Lord Maximus' ship in front of every other vessel. This course of action left the sailor with his life lost in the depths of the sea, as a response to this was the darkhides and their stolen cannons, discharging the first shots that ignited conflict. As one might imagine, the warm waters would prove a manageable one for this sailor to remain in the depths for a little longer than frigid waters, but no. He was without delay, smashed by the frontal portion of Lord Maximus and his ship, leaving the sailor as the first casualty of Hard-Glaze and the Death Ships.

With little time to spare, Lord Maximus and his entire armada was ordered to line up, and begin their starboard side engagement. The first five minutes were crucial, and this meant that everything had to be timed perfectly -- And it indeed was. All ships lined up, one to the next, and began to fire their first warning shots at the darkhide fleet, and just as the first shots were directed in the waters aside the darkhides and their boats, these fucklets started their policy of total destruction, sinking the first Death Ship right next to Lord Maximus' frigate. "All men to the starboard side, prepare to engage these disgusting peasants with everything you got, fire all cannons!" and so the men moved to their positions on every ship, all ships giving the same order. Every warship in the Hard-Glaze fleet began their circling maneuvers in direction to the attackers aboard their pretty ships, there were a total of six ships in attacking distance - Lord Maximus controlling one of them, so three ships broke up from the armada and began their maneuvering procedure. Three ships going left, three ships going right, and so this began the onslaught of the pirates and their boats in the Madagascar strait. All Death Ships equipped with hot oil, and even Lord Maximus' frigate armed with a recreation of the Leonardo da Vinci Triple Barrel Cannon invention, using that instinctively to bombard the hell out of incoming darkhide ships as the ship began its tactical pursuit. These were the first tactical orders of the commander and his fleet in Hard-Glaze name, moving the six ships, all in different directions to surround the darkhides and their attempted slaughter of noblemen aboard Hard-Glaze Death Ships. 
]]

Book_Deathships_Page4 = [[
As Lord Maximus' frigate and other surrounding Death Ships managed to pin the floaters in the middle, it was then that a top ranked official ordered every ship to begin the ultimatum, exposing a pure red flag above the main frigates main topmast, indicating the firing of all starboard sides in addition to the new prototype weapons that latched to each forecastle deck, able to make a full 360 degree turn in their very technologically advanced state, all aboard these devastating Death Ships. These new prototypes were called the 33 Barreled Organ Guns, and they proved their point by destroying at least five ships in one volley, all guns firing simultaneously. Just as the flag was lowered to pronounce the death of many darkhide ships, another top ranked official in the commanding frigate ordered an oil exposure, each corresponding ship expelling its nutrients of blazing hot oil over the pirates that fell into the depths. The oil quickly stuck to each enemy of the state, burning them to a roast despite being in the water.

Soon after the elites of Hard-Glaze military action let loose their hell barrage on the fishing vessels, another nearby armada had arrived after receiving an S.O.S signal from the controlling frigate, beginning their barrage on the rest of the retreating fleet with Special Class Battle Barges, each armed to the bone with many cannons on every side of it, much like a pillbox. These floating machines of war created a hailstorm of fire, and left the smell of blood in the air after leaving nothing but decimation in their holy name. The aftermath was nothing more but a display of Hard-Glaze superiority in warm Eastern waters. Ultimately it showed truly the might of a nation advanced and clearly growing more and more powerful by the years. The Hard-Glaze commanders at the first naval engagement in Holy Hierarchy gave the land-based darkhides a chance to fish out their corpsed women and children who were aboard the fleet of servitude. It was a horrid sight for sore eyes, one would simply only agree to. As one Hard-Glaze commander said during the aftermath of the bloody engagement, with only one Death Ship destroyed and all one-hundred and twenty of its crew killed in the strait, "It was horrible. It's a shame the Powder Boys only arrived late to the party to ruin such in their fleet of intolerance!"
]]

Other officers spoke to the press of what had occurred in the strait of Madagascar, but only in small, broken up words as they too, were devastated by the conflict of losing merely one and simply one ship. This backed up the point that these Death Ships carried some of the elites of Hard-Glaze nobility and highly trained sailors, so it was known for devastation to be felt after the casualty count came through. 

<i>"We have a ruination in our ... 

... midst, the waste of good nobles ... 

... and sailors alike, such a pity ... 

... that they too were washed in the ... 

... waters of the East, only after ... 

... pledging to conquer such ... 

... intolerable scum." </i>

And so the day folded over, and the scum failed ever again to decimate another Death Ship into the modern period. God bless for that prophecy to be fulfilled.

When Fucker Joe, A.K.A Joseph A. Philadelphus, who was known as a Hard-Glaze genocidal killer who ravaged the rural area in the 16th District, kidnapping over 400 people and killing them all. The killer fixated his eyes on a new target of interest. It was the Governors Plantation, commonly referred to by commanding leaders in council meetings as Farmstead 8, or Castle 8. A heavily fortified plantation with a castle established on top of a hill. This well-defended area was Fucker Joe's interest, and he wanted so dearly to plot terrible things against the Glazic Union and strike them deep and hard. So he prepared a week-long annihilation idea of his, to attack mobile, in his vehicle and blaze the crops and all of the inhabitants with the machine gun mounted to it. This was no ordinary plot, he went into full depth with it, deciding what to do in the event he were caught. He had suicide pills, explosive grenades, Molotov Cocktails, handcuffs, and other various tools to attack with. Fucker Joe decided he would use the handcuffs to subdue the Governor and interrogate/torture him in his very own fortified Mansion on top of the hill, while using ducktape to strap make-shift explosives to various places, giving him an advantage, and then he would toss grenades from his windows while in motion as he made his escape from the burning farm. It was an elaborate plot it seemed, but for the Governor, he knew that Fucker Joe was coming. He had a prediction the night prior to the attack. 

A 'vision' one would consider, but experts concluded that it could have been a hallucination after taking various drugs in his mansion the following night, and in addition to having been with many mistresses, which may have led it up to be a mere coincidence. The vision was said to have sparked a new era of alert mentality for governors all mingled, as the governor simply put in his personal agenda papers the night the vision occurred in his mind. The man behind the ink pen wrote and recorded the finest vision ever produced by a Governor in a smaller township region, rumoring the demise of himself and his high-ranking officials as he saw in his horrible vision, though merely as sacrifice to Hard-Glaze and death as honorable as possible with a flowerbed to be pronounced at his funeral.

The Governor's name was Tom 'Albert' Roberto, a man of Hispanic background with roots deep in the Spanish colonization of the Southern lands. He was a ferocious warrior, with at least ten or more gold medals of certification for his success in many fronts. 

He took on the Amish during the beginning days of Holy Hierarchy Wars, decimating them first, and then tackling the darkhides and even the proclaimed Redneck Allegiance Party, proposing Lord Maximus with his trusty hand in combat. Of course after all of these situations, Lord Maximus took note of this well-played master of chess, purchased a Steed representing the Philimonjio and his journey to control all east of the Hard-Glaze lands, and then offered it as a token of gratitude for Alberto. A gift it seemed. It was a brutal display of honorary status for Alberto. Though it was truly remarkable to see him and his armor-clad horse riding into combat, blazing hordes of tribals as they ran from the battlefield. Indeed, Alberto was a man to be worshipped by Hard-Glaze predecessors, riding as a shining example of enlightenment in Hard-Glaze name. Beauty inside, much like Blagoona's speeches, but on a sincere Hard-Glaze level. It was reported that Alberto had a fine acquired taste for things 'bling' in their natural element. He desired products that were shipped far and few to the Hard-Glaze capital, where he would prance much like a tribal in applause to what had just purified him -- The liquor he desired so much, which in coincidence to Fucker Joe's soon-to-be ravaging of a liquor house, in a town not so far from where the action would occur.

<font color='#000' size='4'><b>The Event that Shook The County</b></font>
It was the following morning that Fucker Joe began his demonic pursuit for destruction on a national level, all that would inevitably hit Glazic news stations around Hard-Glazed society. As remembered by several eye-witnesses, they all reportedly saw Fucker Joe enter a small township two miles outside the road of notorious Castle 8, where he picked up a plentiful amount of alcoholic beverages to consume while he inflicted sickening slaughter on weaklings..

Joe knew he would have to blast his way through the beverage store in order to obtain his liquor, and that he indeed did, leaving entrails behind the counter where the man was mercilessly fucked beyond repair in his own business. 

Hours later would be remarkably one of the most disgusting acts of war on Hard-Glaze by a third-party member, the Fucker Joe... His ruthless behavior left a scar on the Glazic stature entirely, causing many nationally titled politicians of Glaze to call him out as a coward in their own words. It was said that during the following morning, after blasting his way into a liquor store to obtain his precious substance, he started up the engine to his vehicle and prepared to ride gloriously into the farmstead of Castle 8, where he would ultimately shoot up more innocent bystanders, and so he did that, in fact. The minute drive left nobody time to escape the demise. Commentators of the farmstead speak in words frightening to many, telling a tale unlike no other. It was said as the engine was heard like a howling wind in the distance, a siren started to blare from the Castleâ€™s alert system. 
]]

Book_Assault_Page4 = [[
This old fashioned device was still in use from years prior, but served its purpose well. The combination of sirens going off and the engine howling left people emotionally scarred. Slaves from all directions took off from their stations, most of them unable to escape but some proven lucky to break the binds of metal around their arms. Many of these workers were chained to their legs as well, unable to fend for themselves, as the engine became increasingly louder... and that soon resolved with the death sounds in the distance too. "Attention, attention... We have a predicament in our midst," the audio man spoke out, it was the Governor Alberto, attempting to ensure everyone's safety was secure.... clearly it was not, as people were mowed down upon the vehicles breach of the outer gates to the facility. Many darkhides towards the front stretch were shot down by the heavy-caliber vehicle strap-on, the entire car shaking unsteadily in its own machinery turbulence, leaving at least more of the workers towards the back of the field to attempt to escape unscathed... 

At least five dozen peasants were initially brought down by the onslaught at the gate, as the rolling wheels continued down dirt paths and into the very beautiful cobble-stone that marked the beginning of the Castle. Molotov Cocktails were seen being tossed recklessly from each side window, as the wheels then caught on fire from the method man's very own cocktails that fell too short, some however reaching their targets and blackening peasants into a darker color it seemed. Then came the grenade volleys.. It seemed as though hundreds of these tiny explosive grenades started being tossed out of the windows in a variety of ways. Some of the grenades clearly inside garbage bags to maximize devastation on the workers. Limbs fried in the breeze, bodies strewn across the dirt and cobble-stone, and not a security official able to weaken the Fuckerâ€™s defenses. More reports came in from the on-ground witnesses, telling more of the story as the muscle car drove up the hill where the castle was positioned. 
]]

Book_Assault_Page5 = [[
"Get the f-fucking rifle, Johnny!" -- The words of Alberto to his personal security guard, the man besides Alberto named Johnny scrambling quickly to toss him a beer-keg barrel that contained the goodies, then kicking the sucker over onto the floor where the Governor resumes to load many loose single bullets into a magazine of his rifle -- A considerably drawn-out process that left the fate of the Castle in both of their hands. The Governor then threw his full body weight against the balcony door to his bedroom, smashing it down with his fat obnoxious body, stepped out onto the top balcony of his bedroom window, where he took a glimpse of all of his profits being thrown down the drain, or in other words, thrown in the air to burn. He aimed down the sights and unleashed a full magazine of hollow point tracer rounds in direction to the oncoming Muscle Car, the car clearly not stopping at this point. The Governor then watched in awe as the muscle car drove away and rolled quickly outside of the fortified Castle gate from the side entrance, leaving dust in every face, and never to be seen again by Alberto or his crew. 

<font color='#000' size='4'><b>The Aftermath & The Scorched Earth Policy</b></font>
It was said that in the aftermath of the attack of Fucker Joe on Alberto's precious cargo, half-consumed liquor bottles and blood all tainted the land and prevented further occupation and work. It took weeks after the attack for things to be considered "normal" again for Alberto and his crew, and although much of the prophecies that Alberto envisioned never occurred, the one that did stick in his mind for the rest of his life, was the original vision of his castle being assaulted. As one responsible Glazic commander would order, the Scorched Earth Policies came after the outbreak of Fucker Joe, in response to what he performed on Alberto's precious cargo. Said to have been one of the biggest epidemics in Glazic history, the retardation and drunkards that consume so much alcohol per household is surely to be locked on the charts for future priority-makers in the Central Regions today.

<i>"I've not a man nor a prophet. Simply an inferno."</i>
-Karmine Willtan - When asked if he was a man or god by a serf.

Karmine Willtan (b. 4E), is a Minister of Glazic Faith within the County Districts. His works are well known across the entirety of the Hierarchy, as his teachings led to the building of the Faith Ministry, the replacement of the inferior Royal Pope system. Willtan is said to be the first man, born as a peasant, to rise to the Small Council due to his political cunning. Even more admirable was his efforts to root out the spread of the Goreic Faith, a puppet religion system.

Many wonder if Willtan was once a firm believer of the Goreic Faith before his time serving on the Small Council, due to his high level of knowledge about the nature of the Goreic Faith itself. Philosophers explained his wide level of knowledge of all topics, including those with controversial themes. 

<font color='#000' size='4'><b>Early Life</b></font>
Karmine Willtan was believed to be born a peasant of a different name. His life consisted of heavy labor, working side by side with the darkhides as he was believed to be of Slavic or Hispanic descent. This, of course, was confirmed to be a slanderous lie as later DNA testing proved him to be a Philimonjio Superior. Willtan, though not renowned as a poet, produced various sonnets describing his laborious stay in the county districts. The sonnets documented his struggles, including the time a peasant had stolen his grapefruit, forcing him to retrieve the grapefruit from the manâ€™s skull.

Book_Karmine_Page2 = [[
<font color='#000' size='4'><b>Rise to Power </b></font>
It is still up to speculation on how Karmine Willtan received the knowledge necessary to become a spreader of the Glaze. To be born a peasant and exhibit vast wisdom is indeed a rare thing. Willtan himself refused to comment on how he gained such information, stating that "I was born in darkness, but then I saw the light. Nothing more." Lord Maximus himself hand-picked Willtan to replace the previous Minister of Faith, who was executed by crucifixion for suspicion of malicious intent upon the Council Pedestal. Karmine Willtan accepted the offer, and was transported to the Palace of the Small Council. His first years on the Council were indeed hard ones, as the noblemen refused to accept him for his lack of true noble blood. In a legendary show of fervor, Willtan retrieved a dagger which he used to cut his arm, drawing blood as he exclaimed, "Am I not appointed by Sol? Do I not shed blood for the Glaze?" From then on he was acknowledged, but it will be many years before he will be truly accepted as an equal, if at all. 

<font color='#000' size='4'><b>Goreic Purges</b></font>
When delivering a speech upon the current state of the Council Pedestal and the Hierarchy itself, a peasant interrupted the scene and hefted a heavy stone at Karmine Willtan. Due to its inferior genetics, the slave missed its aim, hitting another man in the crowd. Before being shot down by guardsmen, the pagan yelled out "Death to the Glaze and rise to the Gay Gore!" Willtan took note of this, as the entire rest of the day he was reported to be very distressed, running down the halls of the palace, banging his head against the walls and throwing pots and pans and silverware across the corridors.

Finally, when his anger subsided, he rallied a peasant folk militia to march into the county district, aided by various paramilitary forces, including the famous Powderboys, influenced by coffers. What came next remains controversial, as many small capital companies were devastated by lack of laborers due to the mass slaughterings that happened in their districts. Willtan refrained from doing an all-out massacre, and instead occupied the districts with his forces, ending the problem by its roots and not by the stem. A famous and ingenious act occurred when Karmine began a public preach of the Goreic Faith, posing as a Goreic Minister. This, of course, was a ruse and served as a spotlight that attracted all Goreic believers like moths to a light. When his speech concluded, the Powderboys, poised in machine gun towers, began spraying down on all those who attended the preaching, leaving none alive, as Karmine witnessed the glory firsthand.  

The slaughterings began shortly afterwards, burning down shantytowns and small villages as the Faithmen ravaged the county districts, the same ones where Karmine Willtan himself was born. The same darkling who stole Willtan's grapefruit in his early years was identified and brought forth to Willtan, who executed him with a gold-plated .44 Magnum, after stating the words "Look at you now, your head is nothing but pink mist." The total death count was comparable to the Reductions of the Fourth Era, but due to how long and spread out the massacres were, historians refuse to accept this act as an Official Genocide.

<i>"Almighty creator, deity, holiness, idol of mine. Give me power, spirit, allegiance with those who have disbanded from my ordnance of an army. Divine overseer, universal forces be with me. And for those demons, fight back in means to protect Hard-Glaze and society from its inevitable destruction. Dump the spiritual trophies for now, and unload the ammunition to purify these unfaithful sinners of the land. Stockpile the explosives, magazine the rifles, warehouse the vehicles, but most of all, plant the inflorescence of Hard-Glaze society inside the dirt for future generations to come."</i>
- Lord Maximus XII, beginning his march on the tribes in the First Era during the Holy Hierarchy wars.

On the silver saddle piece, it shows a carving of a trademark symbol, and the globe in the glove of the Lord, as he stands on his pedestal. 

He wears the glove to give off the symbolism that he cannot stand the grotesque values of the peasant backbone. Therefore, he uses their simple mind as a tool to his regime, for it is his to use.

<font color='#000' size='4'><b>Origins</b></font>
It was the beginning of the time for one to decide the fate of the world. His name was Lord 'Henry-Harrison' Maximus, a brilliant scholar of talents. His name stemmed from his royal heritage. It was a brilliant time for him to decide the fate of many in the region. It was a time of tribal justice, but he knew that there were alternatives involved. The Unenlightened Fucklets grew restless, and with that, came the possibility of war. It was real to Lord Maximus, it was no-longer child's play. It was outright war. And with war, came genocide. And with genocide, came coffers drained. And with that, was death and finality. He aged from royalty as a man of golden status. He was truly the brightest of the bunch.
]]

Book_Maximus_Page2 = [[
Many knew that it was time for Maximus to move on in the world, and so he did. Financially he was set, but intellectually he was staggering. He had to obtain knowledge from key resources throughout the land. And so he did, without tribulation.

The unruly would take years, even decades for one to finally convince this flaming beast otherwise. It was a meek understanding by those who were a part of it, that this creature of fire would decay the world forever. The objectives were certain in this notion: Destroy the lessers in means to save the world. And did they not destroy the fucked ones? Yes, they in-fact did. Today is a living example of that. Nevertheless, the alertness of the retard gave understanding to Lord Maximus.

"Vigilance is key to the world's survival", as Maximus told others countless times in his journey to the top. "Discretion is key", He would also say, during countless meetings around the world. This man of golden status was not only the scholar we knew of in his time, but surely a god. A god with arms, limbs, and a head on his shoulders.  

The year was of the Holy Hierarchy Wars, when the Unenlightened Fucklets had grown stronger, and strong enough to raise hell on the landscape. Cities burned, crumbling to the ground. People gave up. They turned towards any religious artifacts they had, and prayed with those artifacts that one day this hell on earth would end.

Book_Maximus_Page3 = [[
<font color='#000' size='4'><b>Age of Innocence</b></font>
The age of innocence, as some would have called it. They were the days of agitation for Lord Maximus. A common pre-conceived notion of Lord Maximus, is that he lived the life of glory. But what's commonly mistaken for those to see, is that he was not glorious during his 'earlier' years, but in-fact innocent. This personal belief or judgement, has led Lord Maximus to the brink of destroying his own people. And with that, comes the possibility of never giving them the receiving side of things. Lord Maximus' childhood was a violent one, a noisy one. A commotion indeed as many would agree to these words. There was anxiety, restlessness, and an overall sense of insecurity amongst the royal family. The man that raised Maximus, for starters, was a drunkard. A disgusting wench of a man.

And yes Maximus, a thinker at the time, was correct. It was during Lord Maximus' childhood that gave him a bitter impression of his father. And with that, he carried with him for the rest of his life.

This age of innocence was surely a huge misconstrued outbreak in Lord Maximus' life.      

Maximus had a choice to decipher what this all meant, or continue to ignore it as he did at some points in his time. All would render him confused and outright angry and disorderly. But sure enough, there was a translation years later, with the arrival of John Stegmore, a political analyst of the time before Lord Maximus rose to the nobility during the years of reconstruction of Hard Glaze.      
]]

Book_Maximus_Page4 = [[
But then, as the Hard-Glazed Phillimonjios grew and prospered, there came a threat from within.

Long before the time of Lord Maximus and the Glaze, there grew a civilization in ancient America known as the black-hats. But as the clouds of radiation set in, the black-hats became something extraordinarily evil. Gone were their formerly pacifist ways. Before long, all knew to fear the sight of their black blood.

However, at the time, both Lord Maximus and his contemporaries knew something was amiss. For several months, there had been many black-hat incursions into Hard-Glazed territory. Reports from the counties flooded into the capital district, of mutant men in robes and tall hats attacking villages, butchering the populace, and feasting upon the livestock.      

<font color='#000' size='4'><b>Campaigns & Expansion</b></font>
Lord Maximus would not stand for the treachery taking place in his provinces. He swiftly sent for his top generals, and devised a plan. He would levy the peasants to attack black-hat caravans in overwhelming numbers, while his main army pillaged and razed their towns, ensuring their total destruction. After a conflict (known today as the Amish wars) lasting only a few mere months, the black-hats were completely eradicated. 
]]

Book_Maximus_Page5 = [[
With his border secure and new lands acquired, Lord Maximus set his sights west, to the coast occupied by independent Glazic fanatics. After quickly overrunning the scattered rabble, Lord Maximus had increased the size of his empire almost twofold. 

However, the looming threat were the hundreds of darkhide tribes to the east. 

After launching an assault and enslaving or killing the entirety of fifty tribes, Lord Maximus was repulsed at the Battle of the District 10. With this crushing defeat, Lord Maximus tactically retreated to the border, fortifying the entire border with a wall of howitzers and other arms, both large and small, whilst he made plans for his next expedition into these lands.

<font color='#000' size='4'><b>The Wars of the Holy Hierarchy</b></font>
Expansions came years later  in the wars of Holy Hierarchy. It was a storm of vigilance on the tribal populace. A fury frenzy of gold-plated soldiers racing their feet to break into compounds that fell to the tribes. It wasn't unusual for a tribal army to fling piles of fecal matter at the retreating Hard-Glaze soldiers within distance to them. Orgies of soldiers would confiscate the land's treasures and then either throw them in a corner of the compound, or simply hold on to these treasures for no understanding at all. Savages of the more harmonious types, would be reluctant to melt down these treasures for profit. But not all thought that way, and as a result, many decided to ill-mindedly throw these treasures away rather than doing the deed for profits. Valued silvers, gems, crystals, and other corresponding items of ceremonial use were taken to the homeland. It would seem as though these possessions of monetary value were simply ditched. The savage had no idea in his mind how to profit from any of it.
]]

Book_Maximus_Page6 = [[
It was during the later years of the Holy Hierarchy Wars, that all of the pandemonium died down, in what seemed to be a truce of sorts. This time of peace was also a time of great growth in population. When all mayhem seemed to burn away in the midst of the Holy Hierarchy Wars, the neutrality came clear. This time frame of the conquest era was named 'The Pacification' which seemed to do just that. Though not exactly a treaty, it was more of an agreement to put down all arms and discontinue all military campaigns for a brief period to calm down. The coffers that were drained no-longer continued to be drained. The average death stopped as well. 

But then, the bombs began to fall. Entire cities were erased by the will of the Glaze. Both sides were drawn into a total war, in which neither would stop fighting until the one had been completely erased. This unprecedented conflict claimed billions of lives, and nearly caused the collapse of society, were it not for Lord Maximus' divine intervention. 

Not much is known about the late years of the Holy Hierarchy, but what is known is that the Hard-Glazed Phillimonjios prevailed in the face of insurmountable odds, due the efforts of Lord Maximus in preserving the Hard-Glazed system. Indeed, many cities were reduced to ash, but in the aftermath of this pyrrhic victory, the Glaze reigned supreme. 

<font color='#000' size='4'><b>Post-Holy Hierarchy Wars</b></font>
In the aftermath of the apocalyptic Holy Hierarchy Wars, Lord Maximus' empire was reduced to rubble and dirt. However, despite the destruction of pre-established cities, the territory under his control had tripled, as all tribes in the known world had been pacified (during the Cleansing of Unruly). The Inquisition, which ensured that every black-hat and savage not in submission was destroyed, now found itself without purpose. And so, in a demonstration of his noble stature, Lord Maximus granted all former Inquisition members vast estates in a show of generosity. 
]]

Book_Maximus_Page7 = [[
However, upon finding out that the Inquisition (which in their opinion did not contribute to total victory) were being so generously rewarded for their invaluable service by Lord Maximus, the Glazic Armed Forces revolted. Over 250,000 well-armed men besieged District 1, in the largest siege known to mankind to date. The capital's walls and infrastructure were still weak from the sackings of the Holy Hierarchy, but the Maximilian Guard (who bear the Lord's name), staunchly defended it. Lord Maximus knew he could count on his force of expertly trained, steadfast, and most importantly fanatically loyal elites, but they were outnumbered five to one. 

The capital, District 1, was far too large for the 250,000 man force to encircle, and so they set up 9 camps around the city. In the case of a breakout attempt, there would always be reinforcements from both sides. The troops elected their ringleader and General Booby A. Harvington (not to be confused with the latter Booby Blagoona) as the new leader, directly challenging Lord Maximus' right to the Throne of Sol. They devised a plan. The troops would wait until the population of District 1 began to revolt due to pestilence and famine, and then would use the distraction to assault. In the meantime, they would prepare siege engines for their assault. 

Meanwhile, Lord Maximus had not been idle inside the city walls. Delivering many speeches, he rallied public support and established new farms inside the ruins of the Royal Senate grounds, which encompassed over a sixth of the city. Even though the aqueducts and sewers had been shelled by the apostates, disease did not break out. The siege lasted for six months. Because of these factors, the deserters began to become impatient.

<b>The First Assault</b>

Pressured by his officers and nearly-mutinous troops, General Booby began preparations for the final assault. Several obstacles stood in his way. The main bridge leading into the city, and most importantly, to the symbolic Iron Gate of Glaze, was extremely well defended. The General ordered his artillery to fire on the defenders, with limited success, but ceased firing to prevent the bridge's destruction. The General then ordered his elite shock troops, veterans of Lord Maximus' conquests of the Black-Hats to advance across the bridge. Covered by General Booby's best crossbowmen, the elite swordsmen crossed the bridge slowly. The defending force, a contingent of about five hundred Maximilian Guard, did not back down against the force of five thousand advancing upon them. Volleys of crossbow fire rained down on the defenders, but did little damage due to the defender's superior armor and shields. Meanwhile, across the city, the secondary force of over 80,000 regulars began advancing to the walls with massive siege towers pulled by mules. Boxer H. Krammy describes what happened next in his Glazica Historica written in the early Fourth Era: 

<i>"At sunrise, the six-story siege towers which had been immobile for weeks began advancing across the plains on the south side of the capital. Lord Maximus happened to be on the southern walls at this time. The Glazic gunners took note of the siege towers being pulled by mules, rather than conventionally pushed from behind. Lord Maximus shouted with his thunderous voice ""Give them the steel", and so, the steel was given."</i>
-Boxer H. Krammy - Glazica Historica 
]]

Book_Maximus_Page8 = [[
The mules were promptly gunned down by Lord Maximus' dragoons, who fired the Glazic Blunderbuss, to great effect. With the south walls momentarily secure, Lord Maximus rode by horseback to the north of the District, where the elites of both were engaged in combat. During his ride, Lord Maximus was met by many civilians who threw themselves at his horse's feet and praised his divinity. Arriving at the Iron Gate of Glaze, Lord Maximus found his guard in a precarious situation. There were only a hundred defenders left out of the original five hundred Maximilian Guard. 

<b>A Time of Reckoning</b>

Determined to turn the tide of the battle, Lord Maximus summoned his closest advisors to the towers above the Iron Gate. Proclaiming that he still had tricks up his sleeve, Maximus announced his intention to hold the bridge at all costs. Meanwhile, the defenders were being reduced one-by-one from the onslaught of swordsmen and crossbow bolts. Suddenly, from over the tops of the walls, masses of darkhides, clad in white powder and with sharpened sticks, began spilling out. During the months under siege, Lord Maximus had bestowed upon his massive slave population the honor of joining the Philimonjio army. The powder-clad warriors had their senses overloaded from their new-found power, and became fanatically loyal to the divine Maximus. Lord Maximusâ€™ Powderboys were unleashed, and in Lord Maximus' own words, "A time of reckoning has come".

Over the heads of their comrades they leapt, and began a slaughter of the heretical swordsmen. A mass rout began after over a thousand of General Booby's best men died in a minute or less. Mirroring Lord Maximus' actions at the Battle of District 10, General Booby ordered his artillery to fire on his own men, to destroy the immensely powerful Powderboys. However, the Powderboys were too fast in cutting down the General's men, and began sprinting towards his artillery, with nothing but victory on their minds. Still, over the walls more came like an endless wave. In a turn of events that would glorify the Powderboys for centuries to come, they murdered over 100,000 men in a mere half an hour. 

On the south end, the heretics were taking fire from the Glazic gunners, and had begun shelling back with cannons that were previously out of range to make room for the siege towers. The Powderboys circled around the city in both directions, murdering every single man in the camps surrounding the city. However, the Powderboys were momentarily stalled when they began sacking the camps instead of advancing. This proved almost fatal for Lord Maximus, as the south walls came crashing down under the combined barrage of hundreds of guns. Lord Maximus reminded the Powderboys that there would be time to loot once the battle was over, and that if they lost there would be none. 

Motivated once more, the Powderboys completed the encirclement, and advanced into the heretics' rear as they were attempting to spill into the city (but blocked by Maximillian' pikes). General Booby's position was eventually overrun, and he was brought back to Lord Maximus alive by his orders. Following his capture, Booby would endure 40 years of constant torture before finally succumbing to his 38th spooning.

<i>"You speak so highly as to consider yourself a tributary? Then if God wills it, give this man his honorable celebration. Vile thing, remember these words! Corpse the savage, but do not corpse the Philimonjio, for he is spiritual and his integrity is leveled to that of the God that speaks to us in the skies."</i>
-Lord Maximus XII, speaking to the last holdout of Powderboys.

After the eventful conclusion of the wars of the Holy Hierarchy, Lord Maximus had consolidated his power. With his mutinous army subdued and the Unenlightened Fucklets all but eradicated, with the remnants under control, Lord Maximus could again look forward to an age of peace and prosperity. However, this was not to be the case, as several controversies would stand in his way, the first being the most devastating to Lord Maximus' image. 

Enter Booby Blagoona, an immigrant darkhide of above average intelligence and a charisma likened to that of Lord Maximus himself. Some sources say that Booby managed to sneak aboard one of the Empire's infamous Death Ships, waiting in the cargo hold for many days before arriving on the coast. Booby eventually made his way to District 1, an act likely only feasible because of the attention the infamous mass murderer Fucker Joe drew from the Glazic Guard at the time. 
]]

Book_Maximus_Page11 = [[
Reportedly, Booby was able to secure a honorary passport from a sympathetic provincial governor (who has since been executed), and as such was able to gain access to District 1 on a false-pretext of inquisitional duties. Once inside, he began a mass campaign for equality on a scale not seen since pre-Glazic times. Booby's speeches in the Royal Square even captivated Lord Maximus, who enjoyed the speeches not for their content but for Booby's eloquence. However, the speeches grew more and more persuasive, and after a captivating speech Booby inadvertently launched one of the largest rebellions to date, with over half of the populace turning against Lord Maximus. 

Lord Maximus' men could not stop the rioters, for they included many soldiers' friends and family. Extensive damage was done to the city, and Lord Maximus' palace was bombarded by Molotov Cocktails and cannons stolen from the city armory. The rioters demanded the head of Lord Maximus, and over the course of the night managed to break into the Royal Palace a total of four times, each time being repulsed by the Maximilian Guard. 

Booby Blagoona was able to calm the rioters by delivering a speech claiming that they should not fight each other. Frenzied riots turned into cheerful protests, but by the time the rioters began to settle down, the Lord's personal army that had accompanied him on many of his greatest victories arrived, as they had received late news of the siege. Armed and equipped with the best gear on the face of the planet, Lord Maximus set his vanguard loose on the mutinous citizens, and in a slaughter that lasted for weeks, around 300,000 dissenters were killed. Booby Blagoona managed to evade capture by being shepherded away by sympathizers and, to this day, his fate remains unknown.

And with that, Lord Maximus was left unchallenged and so began the start of the Second Era and that of Hard-Glazed society, and with it an age of peace.

<font color='#000' size='4'><b>Fucker Joe</b></font>
Joseph A. Philadelphus, known colloquially as Fucker Joe, was a Hard-Glazed serial killer, kidnapper, and necrophile who murdered several hundred people in the Second Era, before being caught by a detachment of Honor Guard Powderboys (who then ironically murdered him). 

Fucker Joe is infamous for being the primary cause of Lord Maximus' court reforms, including the controversial Fourth Erotica Ban (22), which by extension means he was indirectly responsible for the death of Boxer H. Krammy. This was due to his defense, mainly based on the fact that "a Philimonjio could do nothing wrong." This argument made the trial one of the most difficult and daunting cases in Glazic court history. During his crime spree spanning over multiple eras, the Glazic peoples were stricken by fear, due to the randomness of the victims and Fucker Joe's inability to be caught. 

Executed after an agonizing seventy-four spoonings in the Second Era after being found guilty of no less than 408 counts of kidnapping, 405 counts of assault, 358 counts of murder, and 42 counts of attempted murder, Fucker Joe broke the record for the amount of spoonings endured on Death Row.

<font color='#000' size='4'><b>Origins</b></font>
Not much is known of Fucker Joe's early life, but several sources from the time indicate that he was born to a peasant farming family in the county district on the outskirts of District 2. Farming was a laborious task, and contributed to Fucker Joe's mind-blowing physique which he would rely on to strangle his victims. 
]]

Book_Fucker_Page2 = [[
After reaching adulthood, Fucker Joe joined the Glazic Royal Army, fighting alongside Lord Maximus' loyal men in the Holy Hierarchy Wars. It is from this training that Fucker Joe truly became the killing machine that was feared by the Glazic populace. On his campaigns with Lord Maximus, Fucker Joe had regular encounters with the worst of humanity, resulting in the inevitable corruption of his mind. Fucker Joe went without treatment, and eventually went mad. 

<font color='#000' size='4'><b>First Killings</b></font>
After distinguishing himself in service, Fucker Joe was honorably discharged with generous benefits, buying a home and his signature vintage 1970's muscle car, which was later used to run down many victims. Modifications to this car included a frontally-mounted M2 Browning, an enlarged trunk to store victims, and the removal of the passenger-side seat for storage of weapons and tools. 

Fucker Joe, driven mad supposedly, began his rampage in the rural territories of the District 16, kidnapping over 150 people and murdering them all. During his year of activity in District 16 he was averaging just over an abduction per three days. Fucker Joe also infamously drove onto the Governor's plantation (through three fences and several guards), running down many merry-go berry pickin' slaves while they were chained together and defenseless. 

Fucker Joe's car received extensive damage from security, as well as the drug-fuelled Governor firing at him with a repeating carbine from his balcony of his castle-mansion. However, even though his initial objectives were not met, Fucker Joe escaped alive and with his car in working condition. After extensive repairs, Fucker Joe set off to the west to victimize the Central Districts. 
]]

Book_Fucker_Page3 = [[
<font color='#000' size='4'><b>Massacre of Maximillian Forest</b></font>
Leaving the Governor's burning plantation, Fucker Joe took Lord Maximus' extravagant Highway of Victory to District 1, but took a detour into the national park of Maximillian Forest (named after the elite guard of District 1). In the forest he abducted and murdered over fifty people, but two managed to escape with their lives, reporting their encounter with Fucker Joe to the authorities. 

In accordance with Code 46, the Glazic Minister in charge of the National Park dispatched a security force of Powderboys to deal with the man who was terrorizing his grounds. The Powderboy patrol covered an average of fifty miles a day, running in full sprint to find the assailant. 

Fucker Joe, however, was already on his way out of MaximillianForest (having grown bored of it), but unfortunately stumbled upon the Powderboy patrol, which actually numbered in the hundreds. Fucker Joe accelerated his muscle car to speeds which he hadn't thought possible, and began firing the front-mounted .50 cal machine-gun at the wall of powdered boys of noble stature rushing at him in human waves. The .50 cal hollow-point rounds shredded and gored innumerable amounts of the Powderboys, but the powder-clad warriors maintained their advance, and then were promptly run down by the car. 

<font color='#000' size='4'><b>Panic, Final Murders, and Lord Maximus' Divine Intervention </b></font>
By now, most of the Glazic population had heard the rumors of disappearances, murders, and massacres. In District 1, Lord Maximus stood atop the Golden Balcony of his palace, overlooking the chaos and anarchy that consumed District 1. Panic-stricken citizens looted, stole, and burned, as they tried to prepare themselves for the coming of the antichrist. Lord Maximus knew that to stop this chaos he had to personally stop Fucker Joe. 
]]

Book_Fucker_Page4 = [[
Lord Maximus assembled his Maximillian Honor Guard, and dispatched a legion of them (numbering in the 30,000s) to hunt down and kill Fucker Joe. Armed to the teeth with rocket launchers, machine-guns, and heavy rifles, the Powderboy Honor Guard set out from the Iron Gate of Glaze. In actuality, however, the Iron Gate of Glaze was never opened, but was only stated to have opened in government propaganda. 

Meanwhile, Fucker Joe was rampaging through the suburbs of District 1, destroying entire houses full of people while they slept, torching them with a flamethrower. The Honor Guard arrived one night as he was torching a shack from the District 1 sub-overseer's land. The Honor Guard captured and tortured Fucker Joe for two hours outside the walls.

<font color='#000' size='4'><b>Trial and Spooning</b></font>
In the Grand Courthouse in the grounds of the Royal Senate, Fucker Joe was put on trial for his crimes. Lord Maximus himself was the presiding judge of the case. Fucker Joe, surprising many of those in the courtroom, announced his intention to represent himself in the court of Glazic Law. Indeed, Fucker Joe was an eloquent and persuasive speaker, likely contributing to his success as a serial killer. Fucker Joe's primary defense shocked the civilized world. 

A Philimonjio, he argued, could do no wrong. 

Even Lord Maximus, the creator of Glazic Law and the all-knowing god-king of Philimonjio, was taken aback at this argument. However, Lord Maximus being the cunning superhuman he was, soon regained his composure and countered his point. Proclaiming that Fucker Joe was no longer a Philimonjio by his decree, Lord Maximus quickly invalidated Fucker Joe's argument. He was quickly found guilty and dragged away to the spooning chambers screaming, by two eight foot tall executioners.

<font color='#000' size='4'><b>The Undergod</b></font>
<i>"Behold, the shattered mirror held against the visage of our world, so pure and untouched that those who gaze upon it would weep vacuum. For its form is void, so unknowable, so tantalizing in the coming darkness and inferno that yearns to consume our land - for the light that touches all would be snuffed out, its beaming proclamation of salvation for all to flicker and die, and the children within would reach for the fading light with outstretched arms and gaping mouths, only to swallow oblivion."</i>

At the end of the Fifth Era, the Undergod entered the mortal realm, bringing forth eternal darkness.

<font color='#000' size='4'><b>Theory of Origins</b></font>
Long ago, hidden vestiges of the world were said to possess ancient and otherworldly tomes containing forbidden knowledge that no mortal souls were meant to comprehend - to know these secrets was to live an eternal nightmare where the mind was forever overtaken with the aggregate of existence itself. Those who returned with this knowledge were cast into the farthest confinements of catacombs and dungeons, their writings burned by scribes under orders of the very clergy they pledged affinity to. For all their rantings and despair, those who would foretell blackness beneath the fabrics of our reality were considered madmen, pronounced insane.

And yet, despite every inkling of inquisitorial censure, even the harshest of scrutiny became unwarranted in the face of a lack of knowledge - for without conception by any mortal being was a truth so unfounded and beneath determinant features of the afterlife, or even of Hell itself - lurking in the dark shadows of nonexistence, shielded from the understanding of any being of mortality or divinity alike, was a fact that would spell the undoing of everything - and so indeed, men of holy esteem ascribed earthly titles.

Book_Undergod_Page2 = [[
This new calamity was finally christened, and for decades thereafter - for the precognitive conduits amongst the Loremasters were found to suffer many gripping nightmares as the power of the catalysts were wrought upon Gaia during its infernal purification, and the maws of the Earth's mantle opened to swallow entire kingdoms and billow with the brimming monstrosities of the Begotten. The clergy, dazzled and terrified by the sudden affliction upon all of mankind, turned to their most trusted for ethereal guidance - only to find many of their archivists spiraling into frenzy. Over the course of days, these archivists would perish one by one, choking and spluttering as if suffocating on their words alone - some foaming at the mouth as horrible sickness overtook their body, their delirious minds knowing no quarter. It is said that within the grand magistrate's catacombs, one of the Empire's most composed librarians awoke from a madness-induced slumber, just as the chamber Medici had tended to his care - witnesses spoke that he had restrained the assistant Medicus to his side with great panic and frustration, any and all semblance of soul devoid in his crazed eyes. Shortly before his heart was said to give out, with a single guttural avalanche of hysteria, he warned all who would listen of the eldritch curse that had finally manifested itself beyond the slivers of happenstance, the same being that was responsible for the fall of the great empires at the hands of the Begotten - a being which he coined as being "below God Himself" - <b>"the Undergod".</b>
]]

Book_Undergod_Page3 = [[
Since the decades that followed, the Undergod has continued to exact its sacrilegious influence upon the ruins of Hard-Glazed society - its composed silence and unfathomable nature showing no desire for tithing paid be it in commodity or iconography. From the spiraling voids and infinite blackness from which it came, the only predictable facet is its hatred for all things living, and the slow, calculated vanquishing of existence itself.
]]

Book_Undergod_Page4 = [[
<font color='#000' size='4'><b>Appearance</b></font>
The rumination of the Undergod in any semblance is considered a high crime, an unforgivable blasphemy by almost every leading faith authority within the lands - for the temptations of the icon lead to deprivation and dullness of the mind. To contemplate the Undergod is to dispel one's own faith, a willing transfiguration of the self into a beacon for attack. Despite this, the last of peasant rabble had convened in secret, muttering to one another their limited conceptions of what the Undergod is.
]]

Book_Undergod_Page5 = [[
As a result of these conflicting sacrilegious accounts and texts, it is impossible to determine the true form of the Undergod - when not taking the form of clouded blots and subterranean tendrils that span for eternal intervals, the preferred anthropological icon of the Undergod is that of a newborn baby, a man, or an apparition which draws from elements of both - the informative behind this artistry is clear, as the Undergod itself has been considered a "young" deity, but to do so would be sorely mistaken, as it would suggest the passage of time as a commonality between our realm and that of the Undergod. In more dramatic portrayals, this amalgam of young and old would wear breastplate stained with the blood of slain deities, and a massive, flaming sword of purifying white light - it is said that a single swing of this sword was enough to create the great rifts within the Earth which still remain today.

Despite the detailed nature of these depictions, no mortal being has perceived the Undergod in its true form - those who would, it is believed, shall be swiftly extinguished by the cleansing of the Undergod's essence.

At the very height of power among the great empires of the Philimonjio after the final defeat of the Gay Gore, the mantles of Gaia suffered a disturbance which caught the attention of leading clergy authorities worldwide - great quakes shook the necropolises of the ancient world to their core, enormous cracks within the ground giving way and blistering with the bubbling pools of magma and brimstone which came fountaining into the atmosphere, polluting the clean air and fertile grounds in every corner of the Earth. Tranquil and serene vignettes of rummaging fauna and plant life were immediately covered in ash, blackened carbon polluting the lungs of animals and inhabitants alike. 

As the ravines deepened, ridges and canyons filled with bubbling magma soon gave way to unearthed tusks of flesh, bone, and sinew - thrashing limbs, gibbering mouths and faces were visible within, screaming in flavorful tongues of death and calamity to be wrought upon all of mankind. Onlookers hastily retreated to their great palaces and forts, those Holy men servile to their government displaying the first and only instance of true mortal terror - spilling over fine cheeses and wines, with the first inclination to backhand their servitors for their drivel, soon flushing white as the plates upon which they dined - many officials indeed resigned themselves to their chambers under guard, while the few men of Holy honor who had found themselves among the living.

Book_Begotten_Page2 = [[
The onslaught began, as apparitions incomprehensible to the very nightmares of men appeared within the villages, towns, and homes, their sulfur-slicked skin burning the ground wherever they touched - the peasant breadwinners and wives and children made easy prey to the thralls, as their final moments were punctuated by the sheer revulsion of horror which befell the most dreaded of fates. Residents were poked, punctured, and picked apart in the most unholy and inhumane ways, the thralls savoring their wails of pain and mercy until their souls were fully consumed. Millions across Hard-Glazed society were harvested and brutalized. Those who managed to seek respite in fortified areas were soon struck by the blight upon the air they breathed - the black, choking smoke and a plague that seemed to affect those men unsteady in their faith the most. Many simply gave up, cursing the Glaze in blasphemous tongues and abandoning their faith entirely - they themselves would find their bodies splintering apart and rotting, transforming into an apparition themselves. Most solutions were to kill oneself, before the thralls killed them first.

Book_Begotten_Page3 = [[
As the swarm of malevolent monstrosities barreled towards the secure gates of the inner districts, the men of honor - individuals of Holy esteem and Noble Stature - rose above their station and gave out a rallying cry for their military brethren to take up arms. For many, a life of pious servitude had to culminate in a prophetic crusade just as this - and so, war was waged on every front against the advancing demons. Musket-wielding privateers in echelon cut down thousands of the hordes, while great marvels of engineering fired cannons from secure moving pillboxes and airborne contraptions rained down fire from the sky. Warlords rejoiced, assuring their followers - these unholy beasts shed blood, and if they did so, then they could be killed just as well.

In a matter of days, these Lords would find themselves and their families cornered in their fortress chambers, surrounded by the manifestation of beings, forced to watch as their innards were slowly torn apart from one another and expressed upon the marble walls as sacraments to a new faith. For all too late the lesson was learned - no one escapes the Begotten.
]]

Book_Begotten_Page4 = [[
Begotten, despite being fairly common in the apocalyptic days, are now few and far between. Hard-Glaze interpreters have determined that many Begotten thralls have migrated in accordance with creeds passed directly upon them from their master, the Child God - the new frontier of Begotten consumption is the Hell of Satan, in the efforts of the Undergod to usurp and reign dominion of the inferno.

<font color='#000' size='4'><b>Physiology & Behavior </b></font>
Begotten demons come in many forms, however, the most common warring variant takes the appearance of shambling, rotting carcasses of men - these apparitions are deceptive in their territorialism, for they are capable of pursuing their prey for days on end with an almost insatiable bloodlust, without a need for rest or sustenance. Although Begotten thralls are aptly capable of using their hands or claws to pry apart their victims, many have been reported to use weaponry devised by Man, such as knives, hammers, cleavers, and even diesel-fueled chainsaws - these strange bastardizations of technology are inscribed with unholy runes which singe to the touch, imbuing these weapons with hexing properties which dramatically escalate the pain, blood loss, and healing process of even the smallest of wounds inflicted by them.

Book_Begotten_Page5 = [[
It is universally understood that Begotten thralls pose an astronomical threat, even when travelling in numbers - their persistence, lack of inhibition, and hardiness make them a reckoning to contend with.

<font color='#000' size='4'><b>Power from Despair</b></font>
Begotten do not require worship to sustain their unholy power. Rather, it is said that they thrive on the lack of worship, the very fabric of despair sustaining their lifeblood. Only the foolish would attempt to give any Begotten thrall payment, in credence or penance alike - those who do so would invariably find themselves victims of the next harvest.

Individuals who find themselves of already waning faith are susceptible to otherworldly plagues and diseases wrought upon by the great rending of Gaia - spore clusters sprung from the most elusive corners of Earth's mantle take root within the bodies of men and begin the utmost deterioration of the individual, resulting in an exponentially painful demise. Those who abandon their faith entirely, turning their backs on the power of the Glaze, will invariably undergo a twisted transformation as their bodies distort and splinter, any semblance of humanity and holiness expunged from their mortal coils as the dullness of pure bloodlust and misanthropy overtakes their minds, becoming yet another thrall subservient to the Undergod's every whim.

Many have theorized that destruction of these pillars could slow or halt the incursion of Begotten thralls, however, no demolition attempts have been successful on account of the massive resources necessary to perform such an undertaking. Still, the pillars remain looming over the wasteland, a solemn and foreboding reminder of Begotten dominion over these lands.

<font color='#000' size='4'><b>The First Inquisition</b></font>
<i>"Silence!"</i> boomed the Lord's thunderous voice. Silence overcame the courtroom. <i>"Enemies of the Glaze, quake and shiver. You will be found, you will face my judgement."</i>
-Lord Maximus in the First Era addressing the Black-Hat threat.

The very first Inquisition was formed shortly after the events of the Holy Hierarchy Wars in the First Era. The ruling class, the Hard-Glazed Phillimonjios, found their newly formed Empire in utter ruin, as a result of their holy wars. The common rabble did not recognize the authority of their new lords, as instead they partook in anarchistic mayhem to stay alive in the battle-torn lands. Even though the new Holy Hierarchy was bleeding, it did not have any true enemies remaining. To the West, the filthy tribes were scattered and destroyed. In the East, the squabbling darkhides warred over one another for resources, and in the North there was nothing but tales of crazed old men in the woods calling themselves Blade Druids. All that remained were the threats within.

For the first time in the history, the very first calling of nobility was sent out to all across the known Hierarchy. Every man of power, from business people to wealthy families, to military generals and most importantly the keepers of the Faith, all came to partake in the first Royal Senate. The weak minded fools were put in their place, while the strong and influential would come to cement their power for an entire generation to come. These men would become the first of the Glazic Noble Stature, but even with their great power they surely hungered for more. The nobility elected their First Citizen, the glorious Lord Maximus - an easy choice, there was no doubt to it. He would be the one to call forth arms against any who threaten the Glaze, even those within it.
]]

Book_FirstInquisition_Page2 = [[
<font color='#000' size='4'><b>The Enemy Within</b></font>
A few decades have passed since the first Royal Senate hearing, and the Holy Hierarchy had finally managed to take firm control of the Hard-Glazed system. Indeed, the commoners were put in their place, the rabble quieted, the tribals put to slave labor, and a new Church was erected in the light of holy Glaze in the seat of District 1. Yet the Holy Hierarchy's first true test of their power was soon upon them. Trouble was brewing at court, with many noble houses voicing their distaste of the Phillimonjios hoarding all the true power to themselves. They thought nothing of it at first, petty drama from envious men surely - until members of the Phillimonjios household began to go missing, one by one. Blaming it upon the rival houses, the Phillimonjios started hiring killers to slit the throats of their perceived enemies as retaliation. The other houses would have none of it, for in truth they were not the ones responsible for the abductions. Calling forth their appointed Minsters armies, blood once again was spilled in the Holy Hierarchy.

The scholars made sure to note in great detail Lord Maximus' ferocious and authoritarian swagger as he marched into the halls of the Royal Senate. With his booming voice he silenced the room, calling forth the three top lords of the Phillimonjios family. With one single swing of his mighty blade, he cleaved off all three of their heads, letting their lifeless bodies slump to the floor in tremendous synchronization. The court room was in shock, but Lord Maximus remained still in his resolve. He pointed to the three bodies, exposing them of their black blood that oozed from their torn necks. Indeed, a great heresy was upon the Holy Hierarchy. The mutant scourge that would later be known as the Black-Hats have infiltrated the Royal Senate, by wearing the skins of the noble stature - walking in their flesh as horrific puppeteers, seeking to bring down an Empire from within.

Lord Maximus selected the most trusted of his advisers to organize the creation of the Holy Inquisition. Vance Heimann the First was a man of practicality. While any ordinary Minister would simply pick the strongest of his army, Vance instead looked to the common folk, seeking honest men over brutish warriors. He selected a band of simple hunters from a large forest, those who rely upon their skills of tracking and killing in order to stay alive. It did not take long for them to be trained for the part, as many of these men had already faced many vile witches of the great woods, who preyed upon men such as them for sacrifice. The true struggle was teaching these men the complexities of court, a vital skill that they would never truly grasp, which later led to their downfall. They were given their arms, their books of law, and were finally set out upon the Royal Senate, their new hunting grounds.
]]

Book_FirstInquisition_Page4 = [[
It only took a single month for the remainder of the Black-Hats to be sought out and defeated. Whispers here, a bribe of coin there, and a trail of footprints that led to a guilty fool. The first of the Black-Hat infiltrators were easy to discover, for all it took was a simple cut from a dagger to reveal their black blood for all to see. The deception grew deeper when the Black-Hats hid their true colors through witchcraft. This only increased the Inquisition's power, as they were now allowed to carry out accusations on even red blooded men. Many were accused, and all were executed, guilty or not. Any forces of retaliation that they cooked up from their ranks of mutant men were firmly smited by Lord Maximus and his holy army. The home village of the Black-Hats were uncovered through various means of interrogation, and before the armies could arrive to give these mutant freaks a worthy genocide, they came to discover that the last of their kind had all killed themselves in a mass suicide in the village square. The Inquisition had succeeded in their task tenfold, marking the complete extinction of the Black-Hat scourge.

Too much duty and dedication can sometimes be a bad thing, as the Inquisition would soon discover. Indeed they succeeded in their task, destroying the greatest threat to the Holy Hierarchy thus far, but now they looked further within. At first they tolerated their snooping, until they began exposing men of Faith. Every single branch by which the Hierarchy was governed were facing equal, unrestrained political assassinations, with no motivation other than the various Inquisitor's sense of duty. Lord Maximus had no other option than to officially disband the Holy Inquisition, returning the men to their forest where they would live out their remaining life as simple hunters. Of course, the offended nobility would later send out hired helpers to retrieve these honest men, sending the former Inquisitors to their personal torture rooms where they would never leave. Although the Inquisition was now gone, their work would not go unnoticed by the few faithful nobility who watched as the Royal Senate's corrupt ways were exposed for all to see. Vance Heimann and his legacy would later cause the destruction of the Royal Senate, birthing the Small Council in its place.

The children too, their small bodies cracked and remade into horrors.

The flashes keep coming, lighting up the night. Each time, you hear the screaming again. Sometimes I see Him, see the moment it all went wrong. I feel His despair, His terror. And then thereâ€™s the whispers-Godâ€™s voice, worming into your head. Promises, lies, truths.

Weâ€™re all cursed now. Thereâ€™s no hope. No Heaven. No salvation.

<font color='#000' size='4'><b>The Early Years: Life of Simplicity</b></font>
Vance Heimann the First (b. 1E d. 2E) was not born to wealth, power, or privilege. His origins were humble, and his life before the Holy Hierarchy's rise was spent as a simple hunter in the vast and treacherous forests of what became the county districts. The dense woods teemed with predators and Vance became known for his keen instincts, practical cunning, and unmatched skill in tracking.

In those years, Heimann and his fellow hunters often clashed with the strange, reclusive witches who inhabited the darkest corners of the woods. These malevolent figures, known to lure men to their doom, forced Heimann and his group to develop both physical prowess and a deep mistrust of the arcane. His triumphs over these woodland foes laid the foundation for his future as the first Grand Inquisitor.

<font color='#000' size='4'><b>Call to Service: Formation of the First Inquisition</b></font>
When Lord Maximus sought to eradicate the Black-Hat scourge, he turned to Heimann, whose reputation as a pragmatic, incorruptible man preceded him. While other ministers might have sought to build the Inquisition from the ranks of soldiers or nobles, Heimann broke tradition by assembling his order from men of his own peasant hunters.

These men, accustomed to the perils of stalking prey and surviving in harsh conditions, were uniquely suited for the task at hand. They were practical, efficient, and above all, untainted by the intrigue of court life. Heimannâ€™s vision was simple: the Inquisition would be an instrument of justice, guided not by greed or ambition, but by duty to the Holy Hierarchy.

The early days of the Inquisition were marked by swift victories. Armed with steel, wit, and the holy texts outlining the laws of Glaze, Heimannâ€™s hunters-turned-Inquisitors hunted down Black-Hats with brutal efficiency. They developed methods of interrogation that blended Heimannâ€™s practical cunning with an almost fanatical zeal. A simple cut of the blade was often enough to reveal the black blood of the mutant infiltrators, and from there, it was a matter of following the trail of corruption to its source.

Under Heimannâ€™s leadership, the Inquisition purged the Holy Hierarchy of its most immediate threat. The Black-Hats, those vile puppeteers who wore the flesh of nobles to infiltrate the very heart of the Royal Senate, were eradicated in record time. Heimannâ€™s Inquisition uncovered their hidden villages, their covert gatherings, and their twisted schemes, driving the mutants to extinction.

The Inquisitionâ€™s success brought a brief era of security to the Holy Hierarchy. Yet, it was not without its costs. The Inquisitionâ€™s growing power and zeal began to spill beyond its original purpose. No longer content with rooting out the Black-Hats, Heimannâ€™s hunters turned their gaze inward, exposing corruption and sin among the very nobility they were sworn to protect. Ministers, generals, and even priests fell under their scrutiny, and accusations of heresy flew like spent powder cartridges in the Senate halls.

<font color='#000' size='4'><b>Fall and Demise</b></font>
Though Heimannâ€™s dedication to justice was unwavering, it became his undoing. The nobility, increasingly threatened by the Inquisitionâ€™s relentless investigations, turned against Heimann and his men. What began as whispers of discontent soon evolved into a coordinated effort to dismantle the Inquisition.

Faced with mounting pressure, Lord Maximus, once Heimannâ€™s staunchest supporter, made the difficult decision to disband the Inquisition. The hunters were sent back to their forests, stripped of their titles and authority. Heimann himself retired quietly, returning to the life of a simple man. But the nobility, their pride wounded and their secrets exposed, could not let the matter rest. Hired assassins were dispatched to ensure that the former Inquisitors-and Heimann himself-would never again threaten the delicate balance of power within the Holy Hierarchy.

<font color='#000' size='4'><b>Legacy of Justice</b></font>
Though Heimannâ€™s life ended in obscurity, his legacy endured. The Inquisitionâ€™s work had exposed the rot within the Royal Senate, planting seeds of dissent that would later blossom into full rebellion. The Small Council, which replaced the corrupt Senate at the end of the Third Era, was in many ways a testament to Heimannâ€™s ideals of accountability and justice.

Vance Heimann the First is remembered as a man of principle, whose uncompromising dedication to duty changed the course of the Holy Hierarchy. Though his methods were brutal and his end tragic, his name remains a symbol of incorruptibility.

<font color='#000' size='4'><b>Discovery of the Gore</b></font>
Dating back to the dawn of the First Era, the â€˜Gay Goresâ€™ started off in a shroud of mystery. Originally thought to be a mad cult of northern folk, the Glazic nobility paid them little attention. Early serfs would report to their local Minister about 'mad mountain-men and spearfolk, white of skin' who would watch their villages at a distance. Rumors would spread among the County Districts which bordered between the Gore and Glaze.

It was not until the Second Era, in the aftermath of the Hierarchy wars, that the Royal Senate heard word of the Goreic Kingdom. It was said that a local county district's tradition was to send their village elders to the north, so that they would become one with the snow. For years they would send their elders into the cold winds of the north, and none would return. This changed when an elder returned from their quest with a 'ghastly look,' and a word of their findings in the Northlands. His findings were immediately reported to the Royal Senate, detailing a face-to-face meeting with these men, who called themselves 'the Gores' and spoke of false gods that were of anti-Glazic intent. 
]]

<font color='#000' size='4'><b>Goreic Kingdoms</b></font>
<i>"I suppose It'd be quite requisitory of the Royal Senate to enact a burdening response to these recent attacks on our peasant friends. To sit back, wait, and hope for a digression? Simply put, these Spearfolk must be swiftly cut down before they grow in number."</i>
-V.K Heimann - the 'Steel Tongue' of his days.

Around the early phase of the Second Era, beginning with the first encounter of the Gores at the Gay King Summit, Goreic raids have grown from legendary to quite common and then annoyingly frequent. From ambassador intelligence to captured Spearfolk, it was apparent that a great number of Goreic men were actually once of Glazic faith, and have converted over. Life among these people is extremely simple, their day consisting of crawling around in dark underground tunnels, or in cold villages on the mountains. Strangely, when asked what these men believe in, each response will vary. 

According to the beliefs of the Gores, a great set of deities rule over the world, known as the 'Family.' This family, consisting of two brothers, a sister, a mother, and a father, had created the world by 'finding the way.' The names of these deities never seem to be agreed on, but their roles seem unanimously known. The mother is the caretaker, the voice of reason. The father is the hunter, the seeker of nourishment for the family, but without the other members of the family to support him, he is nothing. The first brother is intelligent, but lacks communion. The second brother is of great communion, but lacks intelligence. The sister is the trickster, who causes troubles for the family, but will also help the family in time of need.

Book_GoreFolly_Page3 = [[
There is no noble class of these Gore people, but only a single faith system that guides them all. A series of schisms along the county districts have called for various purges to occur, but for every dead Gore another rises to take their place. Goreic activities have become widespread knowledge after the late Goreic Purges called by Minister Willtan that resulted in an absolute suppression of the Spearfolk militia. Despite our victories, it will indeed be a great struggle before these beast-men are completely removed from the light of Sol.

<font color='#000' size='4'><b>History & Origins</b></font>
Unlike the other Holy Orders, the Knights of Sol are entirely new, having no history from times before. Of course, there have always been Anointed Knights within the Holy Hierarchy, but such a role was mostly regarded as a status symbol of sorts. The legend of the Knights of Sol began as any Glazic tale of triumph does, when the Light comes to meet darkness in its strongest hour. When Skylight ascended to abandon the Earth, those who remained witnessed an unholy battle. One by one the Ministers in charge of their sanctuaries of Light found themselves alone. Those preparing themselves for the mass suicides were cut short by the horrifying sight of Skylight falling to the Earth, a blazing inferno. Now it was truly hopeless, the last promise of a future for mankind was surely gone. The Undergod had succeeded in its task to purify the world of Man and its sin. When the foundations of the church quaked and cracked, and the Gatekeepers ran low on munitions for their muskets, suffering was soon upon the last defenders. Then they saw it, a crack emerged from the hellish sky to reveal a golden ray of Light, something that none had ever seen before in their short lives. Seventeen men stood tall in the horizon, wearing glorious white armor, wielding swords glowing bright. Demons fell upon them, but these Seventeen hacked and sliced a path through them. Thousands fell by their blade before the demons retreated into the darkness, and it seemed that humanity would live for at least another day.

It has been many, many years since that dark day and now the Seventeen no longer walk this Earth. They may be gone, but their legacy stands tall. A surviving Minister in the county district sanctuary had created a new Greater Order, the Knights of Sol, in honor of the Glorious Seventeen. These Knights may never be as powerful as them, though they will mold themselves in their image, choosing to lock away petty needs and desires of man for a purely zealous and dutiful lifestyle. The rigorous process of becoming a Knight is one of the reasons that the order is so uncorrupted. One must first become recognized by their Lord, often by surviving the ranks of the Gatekeepers, an achievement only one in a hundred could boast. Then they must complete a task requiring absolute bravery, and enormous luck only the Glaze could provide. Even when they are given the opportunity to drink from the holy waters, they risk being 'purified' through flame, often turning their innards into ash, killing them on the spot. Having great skill and ambitions is not enough for one to become a Knight of Sol, instead they must truly be someone favored by the Light.
]]

Book_Seventeen_Page2 = [[
While the Knights of Sol may seem like perfect men, it is not often the truth. Many who have finally been accepted into the Knights of Sol will be consumed by prayer, choosing to live out the rest of their lives kneeling before an altar, most even collapsing from starvation before one. Other Knights may turn to sin as they have been consumed by their own ego, seeing themselves as gods for they have completed an impossible task. These Knights will later feel an inferno obliterating their bellies after drinking from the holy waters in their daily ritual. As a Knight of Sol, if you have mere fleeting thoughts of corruption and sin, it may lead to your instant death following the daily purification ritual. As such, the Knights of Sol holds its name as the most pure order within the Holy Hierarchy.

The duties of a Knight are to serve the Holy Hierarchy without question, and to follow the Chivalric Code of the Seventeen. Following the unholy conquest, there are many territories belonging to the Hierarchy that have no living Lords to hold them. Knights are encouraged to rally up mobs of Gatekeepers or commoners to reclaim these lost territories, holding them until a capable Minister can step forth to claim them as their own.

Knights are given the absolute best equipment available in the royal armories. Despite this, Knights are never seen with muskets or any other sort of firearm. Guns are not forbidden by the order, but to use one would be seen as stooping to the level of a dirty common man. Knights forge their own swords, tempering the molten blade in holy water and praying every step of the way. They may also wear plate armor, although some Knights prefer to fight in their robes as warrior priests. When the situation calls for the use of firearms, a Knight may assign themselves a Squire from the ranks of the Gatekeepers, giving them a list of duties in return for privileges, such as training.

<i>In nomine Lucii et Maximi</i>

I, humble and nameless Scribe in the service of County-District Thirty-Seven, do now commit quill to parchment, for it is both my solemn charge and sacred duty to the Light Eternal that I give account of those grim events which may yet trouble the hearts of all noble Philimonjios. Ours was a Southern district, distant and estranged from the refined customs and gentle governance of the North-Western realms. Ere the coming of the Demon Scourge, our only neighbors were the jungle-born savages - and by my hand I swear, they were of a most detestable nature. For countless generations, the Southern Deadlands lay wild and unbroken by the just and civilizing hand of Glazic dominion. And yet, the stalwart folk of District Thirty-Seven, children of grit and fire, did hold the line.

Let the Northerners take heed: it was the jungleborn who unhinged our very minds. The fathers of our fathers did not plant their boots upon this soil with cruelty in their hearts - nay - such ferocity was born of bitter necessity. Spears were cast with deadly precision, venomous darts found the soft necks of our kin, unholy plagues roamed unseen, and from the shadows crept men of no light, accompanied by gatorbeasts and foul creatures unnamed. In the night, the jungle rose to swallow us whole. Thus, when the Demons at last emerged, shrieking from their infernal abyss, we of the South had already become the necessary monsters fit to endure their wrath.

The Ministry, in their vaulted ignorance, offered but the coldest comfort. With lips chapped from prophecy and madness, they declared the end of all things, and with trembling hands, bade every soul to embrace self-sacrifice as a pious deliverance. Woe upon me to recount that many obeyed, for even before the jungle warped and heaved with blasphemous shapes, spewing forth unholy terrors, spirits had been broken and hope lay strangled in its cradle.
]]

Book_Doomed_Page2 = [[
Yet there rose among us a singular soul, a man of iron and divine defiance - our CapitÃ¡n Dominique. He raised his sword against the Ministry, whose heads he struck from their shoulders with righteous fury. He then proclaimed us a Low Order of Gatekeepers, sanctified not by parchment nor crown, but by blood and fire. With holy madness burning in his eyes, he led our beleaguered ranks northward, that we might seek the face of the Divine hidden within the Manifestoâ€™s sacred pages.

He would not bow to death. No - our CapitÃ¡n Dominique bore within his breast a will as merciless as the sun, and from it poured deeds which the tongue dares not name. The first curse to befall our death-marched Legion was that of starvation. The land, twisted and profane, bore no fruit, no game, no grain. And so the CapitÃ¡n, unmoved and unflinching, offered the flesh of his own six wives - women of dubious blood, whom he claimed bore the taint of the jungleborn. Thus, he declared, their meat was no more human than the flesh of swine or serpent.

Their bodies were flayed and charred, their marrow stewed for strength, and the meat apportioned among the seven-hundred and sixty-two who yet stood. For a few cursed days, the Legion endured - bellies sated, minds fraying. Yet this act, though it staved off death, sowed the seed of sedition.

The first of seven mutinies ignited like wildfire, sparked by the fearsome dread that the CapitÃ¡nâ€™s hunger would not end with his wives. It began with the jungleborn retinue - scouts and servants, drawn from the very tribes we had once battled. They feared, perhaps rightly so, that their lives would be next upon the spit. In the blackness before dawn, they rose in shadow, and with obsidian blades slit the throats of twelve Sargentos - the hard backbone of our Gatekeeper command.
]]

Book_Doomed_Page3 = [[
Yet fate, cruel and cunning, spared CapitÃ¡n Dominique. By some divine instinct or calculated deceit, he had taken his rest not in the upper officersâ€™ quarters that night but among the Soldados - humble, rank-stinking, and safe. Come the morning, blood pooled like baptismal wine, and justice came swift as a falling star. The CapitÃ¡n, resolute, condemned the mutineers to stoning - a punishment as ancient as the sin of rebellion.

Their corpses, mangled by stone and guilt, like those of beasts unfit for burial, were given unto the fire and the pot, thus the CapitÃ¡n made true their greatest fear. Their boiled flesh was promptly distributed to the loyal, who by then had long since ceased to ask where the meat had been sourced. 

The second mutiny was born not of hunger, but of wounded pride. The CapitÃ¡n, in a move that many deemed heretical, commanded the jungleborn contingent be withdrawn from the vanguard and replaced with sons of Philimonjios stock. This was an affront to the Glazic Articles of War, where it is written in iron law that indentured flesh must bleed first for the banner of Light. To place noble-born men at the tip of the spear was seen as betrayal most foul.

Three full cohorts, arrayed in silent judgment, marched to the CapitÃ¡nâ€™s tent beneath the veil of night and demanded his abdication. What followed was an act so dreadful, it seemed as if the heavens themselves recoiled. The CapitÃ¡nâ€™s tent burst asunder in a blast of gunpowder - the Rite of Holy Powderkeg, glorious yet terrifying. Shards of bone and armor painted the dead trees, limbs were torn asunder like wheat in a storm, and the mutineers perished before their grievance could even be uttered.

But the CapitÃ¡n, ever the architect of terror and dominion, was not content. He commanded the rite of Decimation. Every tenth man, chosen by lot and weeping like babes, was bludgeoned to death with iron clubs. Their skulls were shattered, their bodies broken, and yet, the rite did not end in silence.
]]

Book_Doomed_Page4 = [[
For their flesh, still warm, was rendered unto the cookfires.

No longer could the Philimonjios claim moral distance. They who had once recoiled at jungle-meat were now commanded to feast upon their own - to break bread with the Devil and chew the sinew of their kin. We became one in hunger, in horror, and in guilt. The line between Man and Beast was not merely blurred - it was extinguished.

The third mutiny - if such pitiful insurrection can be granted the title - was snuffed before it could even kindle. Three miscreant Corporals, glutted with rum stolen from the Officerâ€™s Quota, drowned their wits and let their tongues wag like damned bells. In their inebriation, they conceived a plan to strike down the CapitÃ¡n and divide command between themselves, like jackals gnawing at the corpse of Empire.

Two schemed openly, debating whether to poison the CapitÃ¡n's broth or load his tent with grapeshot. The third, a coward veiled in craven loyalty, slithered to the acting Sargento Major and spilled the treason like bile.

Justice, as ever beneath CapitÃ¡n Dominique, came swift and monstrous.

The first traitor was knelt beside the great bronze cannon, and it was fired not at foes, but at the air - again and again - until the bones in his ears burst and he could hear the cries of no man nor angel. The second was made blind: his eyes plucked from their sockets with rusted iron tweezers, as he screamed the names of saints that would not answer. And the third - the informant - had his tongue torn out with pincers, so that he might speak no more poison unto the world.

All three were shackled by the ankle, bound in chain, and cast out into the desolate wilds - left to wander as exiles, half-men, cursed shadows of what they once were.
]]

Book_Doomed_Page5 = [[
Weeks hence, the whispers began.

Some among us swore that, in the dead hours before dawn, they heard the dragging of iron - the scraping moan of chains across stone and root. Some saw a pale figure slinking through the underbrush, neither beast nor wholly man. It did not speak. It did not charge. It only watched - a specter of our sins.

None could say which of the three still lived, if indeed any did. But all agreed upon this: the other two had met a fate too vile for even our tongues to name.

The fourth mutiny came upon us in the dead of winter, deep in the mire - that foul, groaning expanse which stretched beyond sight, sense, or reason. A landscape not of this world, where the sun hung low like a blood-blister in the sky and every breath clung to the lungs like mold. We had known illness before, aye, and many good men had already succumbed to fevers and chills no harsher than a common cold. But it was in that mire that we came to know true plague - a curse not born of nature, but of something older, more wicked.

The deathmarch halted. For the first time since we had begun our infernal pilgrimage, we did not press forward, but made camp - for weeks, then months, in that swamp of weeping trees and whispering bogs. When we at last resumed our trudging, it was but a day before the Legion was again forced to kneel beneath the weight of disease and exhaustion. We were made to dwell in filth, and the bodies - Glaze preserve us - they piled like siege stones, great towers of the dead, their limbs stiffened into mockeries of prayer.

Yet we were forbidden to burn them. The CapitÃ¡nâ€™s decree was clear: <i>Let not the dead be set to flame.</i>
]]

Book_Doomed_Page6 = [[
Even I, the chronicler, the once-steady hand of County-District Thirty-Seven, became a vessel of pestilence. My flesh swelled with vile pustules, my skin blistered with strange growths. All were afflicted. None were spared - save one.

The CapitÃ¡n.

He remained untouched, whole and hale, sequestered in his private tent, unseen save for the comings and goings of his jungleborn curandero - a wiry man whose breath reeked of root-vapors and whose eyes shone with the stare of the underworld. This secrecy gnawed at our spirits more than the illness itself. We were dying, and he remained aloof, cloaked in mystery and vigor.

One among us could endure no more. A lone mutineer - his name lost to mercy or shame - strode through camp and set torch to the mountains of the fallen. The fire roared to life like a devilâ€™s choir. Flames danced over bloated corpses, and at last the miasma of rot was driven back by cleansing smoke. We cheered - not for rebellion, but for air that no longer tasted of carrion.

And then, like a serpent from its hole, the CapitÃ¡n emerged.

He bore no armor. His blades were sheathed. His face was unreadable.

We stood still as tombstones when the mutineer raised his pistol and leveled it at the CapitÃ¡nâ€™s heart. Perhaps he thought destiny would strike in his favor. Perhaps he thought himself righteous.

He pulled the trigger.

<b><i>Click.</i></b>

Book_Doomed_Page7 = [[
No thunder. No fire. Only silence, broken by the soft sound of something spat out by the CapitÃ¡n himself - a glint of silver arcing through the air, vanishing into the bog.

Panic overtook the mutineer as he fumbled with his weapon. Before he could fire again, the CapitÃ¡nâ€™s Lieutenant descended upon him like a vulture, and with fists and fury rendered him limp upon the mire-mud.

His punishment, like all that had come before, was devised with artistry and dread.

He was strung upside-down from a hanging tree, his head swaying with the breeze. His body was anointed in honey, as if prepared for pagan sacrifice. Then, six hornets' nests were shattered before him. The swarm was released, a vengeful cloud of stings and shrieks, and his body danced in pain for hours before the swamp finally claimed him whole.

Yet what disturbed me most - what haunts me still - was the CapitÃ¡nâ€™s lament not for the dead, but for the corpses that had been lost to flame.

"Why burn what yet serves a purpose?" he muttered once, as he gazed over the scorched pyres. I dared not ask his meaning, for fear of knowing it too well.

The next day, as we broke camp and once more waded through that blighted land, I stumbled upon something curious: a small metal ball, smooth and dark - the very kind packed into powder and lead. A shot. A round. The seed of murder.

When the mire at last reached its end, and spring touched the earth with a mockery of grace, we emerged changed. The sickness had faded, but it left behind a cruel gift: our skin peeled like bark, and wounds bled as if from sacred stigmata. We no longer bled like men.
]]

Book_Doomed_Page8 = [[
We had become things - reflections of the horror we endured. And as we stepped into the lands beyond, where war and fire reigned eternal, we did so not with pride, nor hope, but with the vacant gaze of those already condemned.

In this new and accursed dominion, we passed under the shadow of towers so tall they pierced the heavens, a blasphemous architecture of cold stone and shining glass, unlike anything dreamt of in the humble minds of Philimonjios. These temples of steel did not welcome us; nay, they greeted us with fire and fury. From every height came the hiss and crack of leaden hail, and our Legion was baptized anew in pain and thunder.

These were no jungleborn - no shrieking savages armed with dart and fang. These were warriors of a different creed, brutish and terrible, whom we came to know as the Shagalaxians. They fought not with cunning or trickery, but with an appalling honesty, as if war itself were their cradle and their coffin both. Gunfire, great iron axes, machines belching flame - these were the tools of their gospel, and they preached death without sermon.

But our CapitÃ¡n - may the saints forgive his sins and his genius - showed no fear. For we, the cursed children of District Thirty-Seven, still bore with us our blessed cannons. With the thunder of chain-shot, we shredded their charging lines, and with sweeps of grapeshot, we painted the earth pink with their fleeing dead. Our jungleborn skirmishers, half-beast and wholly deadly, herded these barbarian swine into our fields of fire, where they met their grape-flavored doom with splendid shrieks.

For days we bathed in victory. The slaughter was methodical, and the ground itself drank deeply of Shagalaxian blood.

But pride, as always, bore bitter fruit.
]]

Book_Doomed_Page9 = [[
These brutes, forged in the crucible of endless war, learned fast - far faster than we dared imagine. Our tactics, once triumphant, became our own undoing. The jungleborn were ignored, our harassers rendered irrelevant. Mines bloomed beneath our feet like metal blossoms of death, and concertina wire wrapped our ankles in the embrace of devils. The towers, once spires of gunfire, became silent tombs that watched as we were picked apart from afar.

Still the CapitÃ¡n pressed us forward - onward through fields of spikes, bombs, and steel vines. We obeyed, for we knew no other life than the march.

Then came the great beast of iron and sky - a flying dragon of spinning blades, roaring like Judgment Day, its shadow blotting the sun from Heaven. It loosed its fire upon us not in flame, but in brown oil, a vile nectar that kissed our Legion and turned flesh to molten slag. Nearly half of our number were swallowed in fire, screaming as their bones wept.

And yet - miracle or curse - the CapitÃ¡n did not die. I saw him, blackened and broken, his face a dripping candle of flesh. And even then, with his jaw half-hanging and teeth like pale tombstones, he barked a command with smoke in his throat: "Entrench!"

So we did.

We buried ourselves in mud and ash, dug into the corpse-choked earth like rats clawing toward a dream of survival. For days we endured. The sky bled acid; our equipment melted in our hands. Hunger gnawed with teeth of glass, and we, unwilling to perish with empty bellies, tore strips from the charred flesh of our fallen brothers. They were crisp as parchment and tasted of sin.
]]

Book_Doomed_Page10 = [[
And in all that time, the CapitÃ¡n vanished from our eyes, as if the fire had taken him at last. I heard murmurs. Some wept. Others laughed. I myself whispered, "At last, it ends." For surely, in that pit of mud and sorrow, we had reached the final station of our cursed march. Better to perish beneath the thunder of barbarians than to consume one another beneath the shadow of his will.

But sleep would not come.

The nights were not silent - they were filled with howling, gurgled screams, moaning prayers that went unheard. On the seventh night, as I lay in my trench with madness clinging to my ears, a new sound rose above the dirge of suffering: bells.

At first, soft. Then louder. Louder still, until it was as if the very sky had been rung like a cathedral bell at the end of the world.

And from the mist they came.

A procession of peasants - though they bore no human gait - clad in rusted iron plates wrapped in cruel barbed wire. They marched with piety, beating themselves with rods and flails, their faces hidden beneath masks of shame. They bore no banner save for their own blood, and with every step, they sang with their agony.

Upon the seventh night, when the bells of madness had drowned the cries of mortal suffering, there emerged from the fog a procession most dreadful - the Order of Eternal Penance, they called themselves. A band of peasants so wretched in soul and birth that the very earth seemed to recoil at their coming. They marched clad in iron crusted with rust and barbed wire, their bare flesh torn by self-inflicted scourges, ever in the throes of ceaseless flagellation. They were pilgrims of pain, priests of agony, apostles of hatred.
]]

Book_Doomed_Page11 = [[
Their flag was no banner, but a man - a man crucified upon a great wooden cross borne aloft by three pale and naked attendants. Nails fixed his limbs to timber, and yet he lived still, his eyes two wells of unshed torment. When he spoke, his voice was like the wind through dry reeds - cracked, rasping, heavy with sorrow. And yet, he praised us.

Yes - praised our holy march, our deathbound pilgrimage, and the bountiful torments we had endured thus far. To these lost men, suffering was the most sacred gospel, and we had become its prophets. Moved by some divine recognition of kindred ruin, they bestowed upon us provisions enough to delay our starvation another day. More wondrous still, they retrieved our sacred cannon from the mud, though this feat cost the life of one among them.

The wretch who took the cannonâ€™s place in the mire was offered the mercy of a swift death - a blunderbuss held to his temple - but he spat at our pity and sank of his own will, his eyes shining with fervent ecstasy as the muck claimed him. Such madness wore the mask of martyrdom.

Then the crucified one, voice shaking the bones within us, uttered his question:

<b>"Which of theeâ€¦ is the CapitÃ¡n?"</b>

No sooner had these words been spoken than a half-dead soldier rose from his foxhole, his visage a ruin of charred flesh and crusted sores. "I am he!" he cried, though any man with eyes knew this was a farce. His stature lacked the iron spine of true command.

Three more emerged, each claiming the title, and one by one they gripped their bayonets, daring each other to bloody trial for the mantle of leadership.

]]

Book_Doomed_Page12 = [[
But a hush came over the penitent host - a sacred silence. All eyes turned to one direction, their flails stilled, their whips at rest.

I, too, turned. And what I saw then shall haunt me until my bones are dust.

A man rose from the mire.

Blackened beyond recognition, his flesh naught but char, yet upright he stood. His gait bore no tremble, his form no doubt. He was the CapitÃ¡n. There could be no mistaking it. Even as he reeked of death, the power of his command pressed upon us like the glaze of Holy Light.

The mutineers fell before him, their pride shriveling to ash. Without a word from the CapitÃ¡n, they took their bayonets and, as if compelled by the very gaze of Hellâ€™s sentinel, opened their bellies. Thus ended the fifth mutiny - in silence, blood, and the glimmer of steaming entrails.

Thereafter, the CapitÃ¡n, that resurrected specter of iron and fire, raised his blackened arm and led us forth once more - this time not into the wilds, but to vengeance. The Skyscraper, that unholy ziggurat of steel, loomed before us.

We marched, our numbers tattered and souls spent, but we marched. Our formation, a loose congregation of ghosts and ghouls, advanced toward its iron gate, ever poised to dive into the mud should the dragonâ€™s wings return. Yet fortune, or some cruel Providence, favored us: the Shagalaxians had thought us slain, erased from existence in that blighted field. Our sudden resurgence stunned them.

Their response was chaos.

They threw waves of barbarian slaves upon us - wretches armed with clubs and blades, while the masters fired from their windows  above. But the flagellants, possessed by fury and sanctified hate, waded through them like the wrath of Maximus himself. I, who have seen massacre and conquest alike, confess this plainly: I feared the flagellants more than I feared the enemy. They fought not for land or glory, but for the beauty of pain.

Then the dragon came, as it must.

Its mechanical groans roared overhead. But our cannon, rebaptized in the blood of saints and sinners alike, found its mark. A ball of forged wrath tore through its cockpit, and the beast plummeted, shrieking, into the mire - drowned, broken, avenged.

With that, the assault began in earnest.

Our jungleborn tribesmen, agile and vengeful, were the first to breach the gates. With poisoned spears they felled the cowards who fired from cover. We climbed, floor upon floor, through that tower of pagan design. Every chamber a slaughterhouse. Every stairwell a trial.

And when it was over, there was no cheer.

No glory.

Only silence.

We had won - yes - but the price was plain upon our faces. For we, the survivors, bore not the countenance of men, but of demons. Our hearts had long since blackened to match our skins, and in our victory, we saw only the reflection of all we had lost.

When next I beheld the CapitÃ¡n, it was as unshattered resolve made manifest. He emerged from the molten womb of the Shagalaxian forges reborn in iron and sanctified flame. Gone was the blackened husk of charred flesh, for in its place was a glistening monument - a cuirass grafted to sinew, gauntlets fused to bone, greaves that struck the earth with divine arrogance. And his face - oh, that dreadful mask! Forged of silver and gold, sculpted to divine perfection, but empty of soul.

The Soldados, once hardened men who had long since buried their innocence, looked upon him not with reverence, but with dread. Their weary eyes knew: this transformation was not salvation, but the final sundering of what little humanity remained. The CapitÃ¡n had become something else - no longer leader nor tyrant, but icon. And icons demand worship or blood.

The Order of Eternal Penance, mad and maddening, were stirred to outrage. Their flails swung with renewed fervor, and their eyes brimmed with disgust. The CapitÃ¡n's glistening visage was, to them, a blasphemy - a mockery of humility, a crown of arrogance upon the brow of a godless king.

And yet, the jungleborn - those barefoot prophets of the vine and fang - fell upon their hands and knees, grunting and sobbing in a tongue lost to memory. Their shamans wailed like wind through broken bone flutes. Their allegiance, once fickle and born of fear, had matured into blind worship. Whether from prophecy, dread, or some fell manipulation whispered through the aether, they hailed the CapitÃ¡n as god made flesh.

I, who have seen idols carved from flesh and crucifixes forged from scapula, felt bile rise in my throat. For each day that passed, the light behind his golden mask grew dimmer. It became abundantly clear to all that we no longer followed a man, but a manifestation.

The sixth mutiny was not a rebellion - it was an exorcism.

We had just finished the cleansing of a corrupted village that dared barter with devils. Their magic stank of rot and desperation, but even their blood sacrifices could not save them. Mercy was forgotten - beheadings were gifts, burnings the rule. I watched one of our fanatics crush a crying mother beneath a stone idol, all while screaming praises to the Light.

And still the CapitÃ¡n was not satisfied.

A Soldado punished for pissing during watch - not relieved, no, punished - made an example of in a way no sane man could imagine. Forced to drink the very waters of filth and waste until his bowels wept into a cauldron, and then - by the justice of madness - boiled alive in his own waters.

The CapitÃ¡n, claiming our pace was laggard, drove us through double marches for six nights straight. With each collapse, the crows grew bolder. They feasted on the fallen while their hearts still beat, and none dared shoo them away - for fear, perhaps, that such kindness might be seen as weakness or treason.

This terror made beasts of us.

And in that desperation, I - yes, I, the chronicler - became conspirator. I taught the old codes, the script of spies and silent traitors. In whispers and glances, in marks upon canteens and scratches upon bayonets, we shared our gospel of revolt.

We dared not trust the flagellants, for their minds were broken by a desire for further suffering. And the jungleborn - fanatics now, high on superstition - would sooner gut us for heresy than entertain treachery. So we walked among them like ghosts, planning our salvation in silence.

Then came the morning of our intent.

The tents were collapsed, and we stood in muster, our hands near hilts, our eyes on the CapitÃ¡n. And then he spoke.

<b>"Men,"</b> he rasped, his golden face unmoving, <b>"we are in the presence of the holy."</b>

I saw it before the words sank in: jungleborn had already begun their work. Seventeen of our brethren - most among the plotters, but others unknown to me - were dragged forth in silence. I will never forget the look in their eyes. They understood, as I did, that we had been known before we had even begun. The CapitÃ¡n had played us like marionettes - his golden mask, his metallic limbs, all perhaps mere theatre to draw out our rot.

And rot we were.

He named them saints - <i>saints!</i> - and sentenced them to be mummified alive. Their tongues were torn from their mouths, their eyes sewn shut. They were embalmed in pitch and myrrh, wrapped in linens soaked in salt and prayer, and left to moan and twitch as their lives ebbed away. For six days we carried them, groaning bundles of agony strapped to stretchers like sacrificial offerings.

Then we buried them - not with honor, not with rites - but beneath a dead tree, gnarled and split by lightning. A tree as lifeless as the mercy in our CapitÃ¡nâ€™s soul.

Our insurrection was extinguished, for whether by providence or some unholy prescience, the CapitÃ¡n had divined our treachery. In the encampment that followed, I, poor and afflicted soul, was summoned to the CapitÃ¡nâ€™s own pavilion - that dreaded sanctum where few had entered and fewer still had emerged. Certain was I that mine hour had come, that he, having knowledge of our cabal, would now visit upon me a punishment both cruel and exemplary. Yet, upon crossing the threshold, I beheld a spectacle most confounding.

There, amidst the dusky shadows, were golden trophies glinting like suns captured in metal, pelts of lions spread across the earth like rugs of kings, and a table of dark, polished mahogany. The CapitÃ¡n bade me sit, and his mute servants - clad in robes finer than any we had seen in months of blood and fire - placed before me a feast the likes of which I had not known since our departure from the County District. Rich meats, seared and dripping with savor, rested upon plates of silver, and flagons of wine glistened like rubies in the candlelight.

I ate greedily, like a wolf at slaughter, until I had filled my belly beyond its humble station and did disgorge it upon the lion's mane. As I knelt there, trembling in shame and ruin, the CapitÃ¡n, whose voice had become as metal upon the wind, inquired of me: "Do you deem me mad?" he said. "Do I now serve the Devilâ€™s court? Is it a demonâ€™s guise that gazes back at thee?"

Struck dumb by fear, I dared not answer. And seeing my silence, he gestured, and I was seized and cast out into the filth like refuse, with naught but my breath and dread to keep me.

What followed seems more a vision sent by angels weeping than any waking hour. I awoke one morn to find our camp encircled by sharpened stakes, thrust like spears into the barren waste. Upon many of these hung the severed heads of men I had once marched beside - comrades with whom I had shared bread, blood, and battle. The few that remained were changed beyond recognition, their forms wasted, their skin corrupted with sores and tumorous lumps, as though the very earth had rejected their flesh.

No word passed between us. We no longer dared speak nor even meet one anotherâ€™s gaze. Those on watch stood frozen like statues of ash, gripping their polearms until their hands bled, their eyes fixed eternally upon the far and lifeless horizon. One soul had hanged himself from a broken pike, and I beheld that his legs had been removed, his lifeless body swaying like a flag of despair in the poisoned air. In the cookpots there were bones - fingers and teeth blackened by fire.

A haze of smoke, bitter with the scent of flesh and spent powder, cloaked the camp like a funeral shroud. The seventh mutiny had come - and gone - like a whisper in the black wind. I cannot recall its shape, only its shadow that clings to my soul. That night, trembling like a sinner before judgement, I buried myself in the ash, fearing they would rend me apart as they had others, driven mad by hunger and darkness.

When dawn broke, I found myself alone. The tents had been struck, the men departed, and I remained abandoned among the dead. Where once stood the CapitÃ¡nâ€™s pavilion, I discovered only parchment and quill - his final mercy, or perhaps his last command, left for me, the shattered scribe of a cursed expedition.

My hands bleed. My flesh cracks like old leather, and my eyes are near lost to rot. I know not what land I am in, nor what day has dawned. Yet I know this: with these last words, I complete my charge - my sacred burden - in service of the Light. And should any soul ever behold our standard, that sun of argent and gold held aloft by damned men, I beg thee to pray, pray to whatever voice might yet answer, ere it is swallowed by silence.
