<i>"...And unto which, I heard our County District Minister return with most glorious glee. The spooning of Fucker Joe, a menace to Glazic Society, had been accomplished. Many men were satisifed and relieved by the results, but someone of such reputation does not just disappear into the fucking void. I knew that even if the Menace were to be dead, his namesake would continue to violate our consciousness."</i>

To those that read this. Be it discarded by those who are of rival faiths or history that has born leeway in blood. History tells us quite a lot.

All the books and culmination of between the First and Fifth eras have taught me something. Humans exist to fight.

The political works of Krammy and his incentivization of the Royal Senate, the dissolution of said senate by Lord Maximus’ hands, the attack upon the gores Great Tree by Glazic forces, and the scouring of Satan.

It's enough to almost sympathize with he-who-shall-not-be-named. What proof do we have that with his departure, will we even return to greater things? We don't. 

But in this conflict, I learnt a second thing. We fight to exist.
