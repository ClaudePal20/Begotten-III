<font face='Acadian Runes' color='#dbdbdb' size='4'><b>Succession of the Bark Throne</b></font>
<font face='Acadian Runes' color='#dbdbdb'>Lo, hear now the tale of the rise of Clan Ghorst to the seat of the Bark Throne, as told by the seer’s sight. When the world was young, and the Family yet unknown to our kind, strength alone ruled the day—sharpened sticks, stones cast by calloused hands, and clubs of heavy wood were the tools of battle. Victory belongs to those with brute force and no more. But then, when the Great Tree was planted and the Blade Druids first walked among us, the winds of change swept across the land.

The Druids, keepers of the sacred roots, bore gifts from the gods themselves: gleaming blades of steel, sharp as the mountain winds and bright as the stars. Our people, struck with awe, held these swords as divine relics, wielding them in glorious battle. Yet none dared question their making, save for the bold and scorned Shagalaxians.</font>

<font face='Acadian Runes' color='#dbdbdb' size='4'><b>The Knowledge that Spawned Heresy</b></font>
<font face='Acadian Runes' color='#dbdbdb'>After the rise of the Blade Druids to the Grandfatherland, to the clans at the time, the Shagalaxians were naught but cowards, unworthy of the blood-honor of warriors. Where others wore their blades to rust and ruin, the Shagalaxians turned away from battle, consumed by a single obsession—the discovery of how to make such a weapon. They saw not divine gifts in the swords of the Druids, but proof of forge-fire. For their questioning, they were cast out, mocked, and despised.

Yet, guided by whispers of the Young Son, the Shagalaxians were undeterred. It is said that in the ashes of a Blade Druid’s bones, they saw a vision: All things can be reforged. This revelation led them to the frozen peaks of the Northlands, to the fire at the heart of the mountain—the First Forge, older than time itself. There, they uncovered the secret of steel, bending it to their will, reshaping their destiny and that of our people.</font>

<font face='Acadian Runes' color='#dbdbdb'>When the Shagalaxians returned, the clans were broken, their divine swords dulled against cousins and their faith wavering. The Shagalaxians came not as cowards but as conquerors, clad in unyielding armor and wielding steel sharper and deadlier than any seen before. They carved a bloody path to the Bark Throne, seizing it not by divine favor but by mastery of the forge.

Under their rule, the First Goreic Kingdom was born, and the faith of the Family was restored. Their forges roared, reshaping the spoils of war into machines of death: steam-belching beasts, dragons of iron, and armor that could not be pierced. Even mighty Clan Ghorst bent the knee, and the Shagalaxians stood unchallenged, lords of an Age of Might.</font>

<font face='Acadian Runes' color='#dbdbdb'>But the seeds of downfall were planted. In the war before darkness, the Great Tree was set aflame by the craven Maximus, servant of the Second Family. Chaos swept the land, and the Shagalaxians, so reliant on their machines, were left shattered. Wrathalax the Mad, the last king of Shagalax, turned to blasphemy in his desperation.

Twisting the Young Son’s words, he sought salvation not in the forge but in the broken remnants of his machines, the rusted scrap metal. From these shattered husks, he forged the Machine God—a being of grinding iron and unholy power. His followers, the Harbingers of the Machine God, toiled in secret, building their heretical monstrosities of machine corpses in the shadowed depths of Forgehome, the Shagalaxian stronghold.

In their heretical home, they built the ultimate defilement of the gods, the Grinder. The relic that would serve as the Machine God’s vessel.</font>

<font face='Acadian Runes' color='#dbdbdb'>The seers foretold doom: a mountain of iron that would devour the Great Tree’s remains in a crusher maw and drown the world in molten slag. In this dark hour, Magthar Ghorsthand, chieftain of Clan Ghorst, called the clans to unite. Even the loyal Shagalaxians, those who rejected Wrathalax’s teachings, rose to the challenge.

The united clans laid siege to Forgehome, a city of choking smog and jagged steel. Blood flowed like rivers, but the wisdom of the redeemed Shagalaxians turned the tide against the scrap monstrosities, as they knew their weaknesses. Wrathalax, now a fusion of flesh and iron, met Magthar in the Grinder’s sanctum. Their duel shook the very earth, but it was Magthar who struck the final blow, severing Wrathalax from his heretical machine and ending his reign of terror. Forgehome was reduced to ash, and with it, the Grinder.</font>

<font face='Acadian Runes' color='#dbdbdb'>The loyal Shagalaxians were honored, their place among the clans restored. They became symbols of redemption, yet those who clung to the Machine God’s blasphemy left in exile before their heresy could be discovered. In the barren wastes, these exiles built a city of scrap metal, a grim fortress of rust and fire, where they toil still to revive their false god. Their haunted cries echo a mockery of their origins in the form of their unholy chant:</font>

<font face='Acadian Runes' color='#dbdbdb' size='4'><b>The Reaper King</b></font>
<font face='Acadian Runes' color='#dbdbdb'>In the days of fire, when the earth trembled under the Begotten, Clan Gore rose to dominance. From the Father, strength and fury were passed down, and from his will, Clan Gore was born. But this tale does not begin in the halls of greatness—it begins with a boy cast aside, born of a war chief’s shame.

Clan Ghorst, once the ruling clan and claimants to the title of Father’s children, held power in the land. The mighty war chief of Ghorst was a man of pride, too proud, for he sired a bastard son—an heir to whom he could not claim. In his arrogance, he abandoned the boy to the wilderness, leaving him to be torn apart by the wolves. Little did he know that the wolves would not devour the boy, but raise him as one of their own. They taught him the ways of the wild, the laws of blood and claw, and the power of the hunt.

The boy was no mere cub. He grew fierce, stronger than any man, his heart forged in the darkness of the wilds. He fought bears with his bare hands, tearing through their thick hides with his teeth and claws. No beast was too strong, no challenge too great. The boy learned to stalk the land, his senses sharp as a wolf’s. He became one with the forest, his body as strong as stone, his hunger insatiable.</font>

<font face='Acadian Runes' color='#dbdbdb' size='4'><b>Epiphany of Betrayal</b></font>
<font face='Acadian Runes' color='#dbdbdb'>In the quiet of the night, the boy—now a man—watched from afar. He saw the banners of Clan Ghorst fluttering in the winds, and from the shadows, he observed the halls where his father ruled. His heart burned with questions. Who was he? Why had his father cast him aside? The truth of his bloodline was hidden from him, veiled by years of silence and bitterness. 

But he watched until the day he knew the truth. His father had been the war chief of Clan Ghorst, the one who cast him into the wilds as though he were nothing. His father, the mighty war chief of Ghorst, the provider of the Clans, had abandoned his own flesh and blood.

For years, the men of Clan Ghorst whisperer of contempt for their leader. They called him a coward, a fool, for the heart of their leaders through the generations had grown soft since the fall of the Shagalaxians. They spoke of his pride and his shame, of the bastard child he had abandoned. Yet none dared challenge him, for he was the greatest warrior to ever walk the land. His strength was unmatched, his ferocity without equal. No man could stand against him—not even in his weakened state.

But the boy, now a man, was not like the rest. He had learned the ways of wolves and the language of the hunt. He had learned to wait, to bide his time. And when the time came, he moved with the speed of a javelin, his heart filled with the fire of vengeance.</font>

<font face='Acadian Runes' color='#dbdbdb' size='4'><b>The Reaper King’s Assault on the Great Hall</b></font>
<font face='Acadian Runes' color='#dbdbdb'>Reaper King Kalkaslash, as he now called himself, stormed the long hall of Clan Ghorst to the heart of the Bark Throne. With claws sharp and eyes burning with rage, he took what was rightfully his. He tore through the warriors of Clan Ghorst with ease, each strike a testament to his years of training in the wilds. Finally, he found his father, the once-mighty war chief. Without hesitation, Kalkaslash shredded his father with his claws, cutting through flesh and bone like a blade through butter. The halls of Clan Ghorst were stained red with the blood of the traitor.

And so, the war chief of Ghorst fell, and with him, the clan. Kalkaslash ascended to the throne, the halls of Clan Ghorst now echoing his name. His rise was swift, his power undeniable. The warriors of Ghorst kneeled before him. Their hearts filled with both fear and awe as they swore fealty to the Reaper King. And from that day forth, they took the name of Gore, for they were now his, bound by blood and the will of the Father.</font>

<font face='Acadian Runes' color='#dbdbdb'>Clan Gore, the Crown Clan, was born from the ashes of betrayal and vengeance. Kalkaslash’s army, stronger and fiercer than any other, swept across the land, bringing all the other clans to bow before him. None could stand against the might of the Reaper King, whose claws and strength had torn apart the very foundation of Clan Ghorst.
The Father’s will was done. As long as Kalkaslash’s blood ran hot with fury, no one would dare defy him. The Reaper King had taken his place, and his name would be remembered in stone, in blood, and in the hearts of all who feared his reign.

This is the tale of the rise of Clan Gore, of the boy raised by wolves, and of the Reaper King Kalkaslash, whose strength would bring ruin to all who dared oppose him. May his name endure.</font>

<font face='Acadian Runes' color='#dbdbdb' size='4'><b>Arrival of the Blade Druids</b></font>
<font face='Acadian Runes' color='#dbdbdb'>The tale of the Blade Druids is one every Gore knows, though the truth of it is buried beneath frost and blood, scattered in the winds of time. It is said they came to us in the darkest of days, when our lands lay broken and the spirits of the dead howled in the cold night. The Northlands, once a place of might, had been shattered in the Old Wars. What was left of our people roamed the Deadlands like starving wolves, fighting over scraps, with no purpose.

Then the Druids appeared. No one knows where they came from. Some say they were messengers of the Family, the five gods who shaped the world and watch it still. Others believe they were remnants of a forgotten age, or wanderers drawn to the Great Tree. What we do know is this: they carried blades unlike anything we’d seen, metal forged from the bones of gods themselves, sharp enough to cut the wind. They spoke little, but their presence was enough to quiet even the most bloodthirsty chieftain.

The Druids did not demand allegiance—they led. Across the frozen wastes they guided our scattered tribes, through blizzards and dead forests, until we came to the place of miracles: the Great Tree. It stood as tall as a mountain, its roots deep in the crust of the earth, its branches spreading wide as the heavens. But most notably, around it, the land lives. The frost had not killed the land, the air was warm, and the soil was rich. Animals lived in peace, the water was pure and ever flowing, and the ancient temples of the Druids stood tall. It was there, in the shadow of this sacred tree, that the Druids spoke of the Family.</font>
]]

Book_Druids_Page2 = [[
<font face='Acadian Runes' color='#dbdbdb' size='4'><b>The Family</b></font>
<font face='Acadian Runes' color='#dbdbdb'>The Family—five gods, both cruel and kind, who rule over life, death, and the Grandfatherland where the worthy arrive. The Druids said we had forgotten the Family, turned our backs on them, and that this was why the Northlands had been consumed by death. But they also said there was hope. Beneath the Great Tree, we could find redemption and the gods’ favor once more.

Yet we Gores are not a people who take words alone. We wanted answers—proof. We wanted to hear the gods speak, to feel their power. And so, the Druids would become the vessels of their power. Dragging them to the roots of the Great Tree and laid them down in offering to the gods. Their blood ran into the soil, and the Tree trembled with the power of their sacrifice.
It is said that the gods answered. The sky darkened, and a vision came to all who stood beneath the Tree. It bestowed upon them the horrors of the Old Wars—the betrayal, the slaughter, the fall of the Northlands. They saw the lords of the Empire of Light, fat and gluttonous, sitting on thrones of stolen gold. And they saw themselves, the Gores, rising from the ashes, breaking the Empire’s crowns, and spilling their blood like mead at a feast. It was a promise of vengeance and glory.

In the beginning, the vision did not unite us—it divided us. Some believed the gods called for war, to march south and destroy the Empire. Others claimed the vision was a warning, a reminder of what happens when hubris blinds a people. The tribes quarreled, then battled, and more blood was spilled beneath the Tree.</font>

Book_Druids_Page3 = [[
<font face='Acadian Runes' color='#dbdbdb' size='4'><b>The First Kingdom</b></font>
<font face='Acadian Runes' color='#dbdbdb'>Yet from the chaos, one Clan rose above the rest, united the tribes, forged the first Kingdom, and swore an oath to the Family: the Empire of Light would pay for its sins in blood.

The Druids are long gone now, their bodies feeding the roots of the Great Tree. Their blades lie rusting in the snow, their purpose fulfilled. But their legacy lives on, in the war songs of the Gores and the scars we carry on our hearts. Some say the Druids knew they would die, that their sacrifice was the will of the gods.

Whatever the truth, one thing is certain: the gods demand blood, and we Gores are all too willing to give it. Let the Empire tremble. The North remembers, and we do not forgive.</font>

<font face='Acadian Runes' color='#dbdbdb' size='4'><b>The First Blind Seer</b></font>
<font face='Acadian Runes' color='#dbdbdb'>The first was Aloris, born of the sign of The Mother, of the clan they call the Crast. We are the fallen, the unwanted, those once cast from cliffs to die upon the rocks below. Yet, through one life spared and a destiny woven in the roots of the Great Tree, we endured, our name now whispered with reverence across the Clans.

In the days after the Blade Druids, the children born under The Mother were seen as weaklings, burdens unfit for the harsh cycle of survival. The Mother, goddess of life and death, was respected, but her children were deemed unworthy. While the followers of other members of the Family grew into mighty warriors, those of The Mother were thrown from the high cliffs, their bodies returned to the earth to nourish the soil.

But our story begins with an exception—a single moment where the Family chose a different path.</font>

<font face='Acadian Runes' color='#dbdbdb' size='4'><b>The Crast Who Was Spared</b></font>
<font face='Acadian Runes' color='#dbdbdb'>Aloris was to die, like so many before him. Blind from birth, his frail body was held over the cliffs as the elders chanted the old rites. But something stopped the hand of the one who held him. Perhaps it was pity, or perhaps the wind carried The Mother’s voice that day. Whatever the cause, he was not thrown. Instead, he was left in the forest, abandoned but alive.

The forest became his cradle, its creatures his kin. The ravens spoke secrets, and he heard their wisdom. Alone, he grew, his blindness no hindrance as the world around him spoke in ways others could not hear. He began to see without eyes, to know without knowing, to sense the threads of fate as they wove through the trees and skies.

One evening, as Aloris rested beneath the boughs of an ancient oak, sharing secrets with ravens all around, he saw a vision—a blade in the dark, its edge meant for the king who sat upon the Bark Throne. Without hesitation, he journeyed to the great hall, a frail and filthy child stepping into the world of Gore.</font>

<font face='Acadian Runes' color='#dbdbdb' size='4'><b>The King’s Mercy</b></font>
<font face='Acadian Runes' color='#dbdbdb'>The others would have struck him down, but the king, curious at his intrusion, bade them stop. <i>“Speak,”</i> the king commanded, and so he did. He told him of the assassin of black blood waiting in the shadows, with the visage of a Goreic man but the honor of a killer; a dagger meant for his heart. Skeptical but intrigued, the king had his men search the village, and there they found the would-be killer, just as Aloris had foretold.

For sparing his life, the king spared Aloris, and he told the king of his origin—how he was one of The Mother’s children, left to die but saved by chance. Moved by his story, the king decreed a change: no longer would all children born under The Mother be cast from the cliffs. Instead, one in every ten would be spared, their lives a tribute to The Mother’s gifts.

And so, the Crasts were born—not as warriors or rulers, but as something else entirely.</font>

<font face='Acadian Runes' color='#dbdbdb' size='4'><b>Seers of the Forest</b></font>
<font face='Acadian Runes' color='#dbdbdb'>Clan Crast, though few, began to grow in number. Those of us spared from death often bore strange marks of The Mother’s favor. Some were disfigured, others born with peculiar talents. Many of us, like myself, were gifted with The Vision, able to see the paths of fate winding through where others only saw darkness.

<font face='Acadian Runes' color='#dbdbdb' size='4'><b>The Turning Point</b></font>
Even so, mistrust lingered. It was not until years later, when we foresaw the dragons of the plump lords descending upon the Great Tree, that the Crasts were truly accepted. No one believed us. The warriors laughed at our  visions, calling us relics of a foolish past. But when the dragons came, as we had warned, and their flames scarred the sacred tree, they could no longer doubt.

The earth cracked open, the sky shattered, and the sea howled from the burnt remains of the Great Tree, pouring forth the Begotten. From that day onward, the Clans revere the Crasts. Though they still kept their distance, they now understood that The Mother’s children, strange and fragile though we might seem, were vital to their survival.</font>

Book_Crast_Page5 = [[
<font face='Acadian Runes' color='#dbdbdb' size='4'><b>The Future of the Crasts</b></font>
<font face='Acadian Runes' color='#dbdbdb'>In the aftermath of the Great Tree’s destruction and the fall of the great Shagalaxian armies under the Mad King, it was the Crasts who exposed the betrayal within the Clans—those who had allied themselves with the Harbingers of the Machine God. These traitors sought to offer the Great Tree’s remains as tribute, allowing the Harbingers to fulfill their prophecy: a mountain of iron descending to devour the Tree in a crushing maw, drowning the land in molten slag. Guided by our visions, we stopped this catastrophe before it could begin, rooting out the conspirators and scattering the Harbingers.

Now, as I tell this tale, the Crasts prepare for our greatest challenge. The Great Tree, wounded, begins to wither. Its roots falter, and the land suffers with it. We, the Crasts, are tasked with guiding the Clans to restore the Tree’s power. The warriors and rulers, once so quick to cast us aside, now stand by us, waiting for our guidance.

The Mother’s children were once seen as weak, but we have shown them the truth: strength lies not only in muscle or steel but in wisdom, in foresight, and in understanding the cycles of life and death.

We are the Crasts, the fallen who rose. And through us, The Mother’s will endures.</font>

<font face='Acadian Runes' color='#dbdbdb' size='4'><b>The Leviathan</b></font>
<font face='Acadian Runes' color='#dbdbdb'>The seas were not always ours. For years, they were dominated by the Death Ships, vessels of iron and flame, manned by the fat lords who claimed the waves as their holy dominion. These ships swept the oceans clean of opposition, their might a testament to the oppressive empire. The Goreic Clans, bound to the land, fought bitter wars against their tyranny, sharpening our strength for the day we would break their skulls.</font>

<font face='Acadian Runes' color='#dbdbdb' size='4'><b>Destruction of the Death Ships: Clan Harald’s Exploration</b></font>
<font face='Acadian Runes' color='#dbdbdb'>That day came when the Death Ships were brought to ruin, their armada shattered by the fury of the Harald clan. With their fleet reduced to ash and their dominion broken, the seas became silent once more. It was then that Clan Harald rose to claim what had been denied us for so long.

The Haralders, as ever, saw the sea not as a barrier but as a path. They built the first longships, sleek and swift, designed to dance upon the waves and carry them into the unknown. The Seawolf, their first exploration vessel, became a symbol of their daring spirit. It was more than a ship—it was a promise to the Old Son, the ancient god of the seas, that the Haralders would honor the waters with their courage and their craft.

In time, their voyages took them farther than any had dreamed. They discovered new shores, transported Eastern riches to the Clans, and became the vanguard of exploration. Yet it was on one such journey, aboard the longship Stormhowl, that they faced their greatest trial.</font>

<font face='Acadian Runes' color='#dbdbdb'>The Stormhowl sailed north, beyond the fjords and the cold winds, to the edge of the world where the sea is said to fall away into darkness. Their aim was the Deep Trench, a place whispered of in old stories, where the Old Son’s presence is strongest. The journey was perilous, but the Haralders were undeterred.

It was there, at the edge of the known world, that storm struck. Waves towered higher than the mast, and the winds screamed with a fury that seemed alive. Lightning ripped through the Grandfatherland, and the Stormhowl was tossed as though it were a toy. The crew fought valiantly, but the storm’s wrath was too great.

As the storm reached its peak, the sea itself seemed to split open, and from its depths it rose. It was no mindless beast nor a new god, but the Old Son itself, its vast form rising to meet its faithful. Its skin was the color of the storm, and its eyes were deep and knowing, as if they held the weight of the ocean’s secrets. Tentacles larger than the ship itself unfurled, cradling the Stormhowl and lifting it from the fury of the waves.

In the presence of the Leviathan, the storm fell silent. A deep hum resonated through the air, a sound that seemed to carry the voice of the Old Son. The crew, awestruck, could do nothing but bow their heads in respect, for they knew they had been found worthy to carry our people to the farthest reaches of the land.</font>

<font face='Acadian Runes' color='#dbdbdb'>When the Leviathan retreated to the depths, it left the Haralders in calm waters, their ship untouched. By some divine grace, they awoke at the docks of the homeland, their longship resting as though it had never faced the storm. The Leviathan, they said, was not merely the Old Son made manifest—but a sign of their bond with the sea, a legend that would endure through the ages.</font>

<font face='Acadian Runes' color='#dbdbdb' size='4'><b>A Legend Among the Clans</b></font>
<font face='Acadian Runes' color='#dbdbdb'>From that day forward, the tale of the Leviathan became a cornerstone of Clan Harald’s identity. A reminder of the divine power that watches over them and the seas they hold dear. The story spread among the Clans, not as heresy but as a testament to the Haralders’ courage and their closeness to the divine.

Clan Harald’s bond with the Leviathan is a legacy that reminds us all: the gods walk among us, not in distant skies but in the heart of the world itself.</font>

<font face='Acadian Runes' color='#dbdbdb'>Hear the tale of Clan Reaver and their worship of the Sister, our deity of darkness and deception. With their mastery over trade, markets, and dark rituals, they have forged destiny. Fear and respect intertwine around the Reavers, for they are a Clan as brutal as they are wealthy. Their Red Wolves carve through enemies with merciless precision, leaving no one standing in their wake. Yet, it is not only their might in battle that defines them.

The Reavers are the stewards of wealth, the upholders of coin and loot. It was they who brokered the first deal with the Nigerii, connecting the eastern lands to our own, bringing prosperity and riches to the kingdom. Through their mastery of slavery and manipulation, they controlled the flow of goods and information, earning their role as speakers of the Sister. Their stronghold, the Hall of Tears, stands as a dark and whispered place among the branches, where souls are suspended in torment between life and death, tortured for the amusement of their captors.

The rift between Clan Reaver and Clan Harald began in pride, a pride that quickly morphed into hubris. Clan Harald, bold and unyielding after their encounter with the Leviathan- the Old Son made flesh, devised a ritual to navigate the River Styx, the sacred river of the Sister, believing it was their divine right to explore the realms beyond. To the Haralders, this river was a test of courage, a symbol of their unbreakable bond with the Old Son. But to the Reavers, this was sacrilege, an affront to their goddess.</font>

The ship, a great vessel built for war and exploration, was manned by a crew of the most daring sailors in the clan. They set forth with chants of bravery, their hearts filled with confidence, believing no force could stop them from claiming the river’s secrets. But the journey was not as they had imagined. The Firebarge sailed deeper and deeper into the lava, crossing the threshold where life and death intertwined.

Days turned to weeks, and no word came from the crew. The Haralders, accustomed to the seas, grew restless, waiting for a sign, a return, anything to confirm the Firebarge had completed its journey. But none came. The sailors of the Firebarge never returned.
It was only after the mysterious disappearance of the longship that rumors began to spread. Whispers filled the air, and the air grew heavy with dread. No one knew what had become of the Firebarge, and no one could explain the absence of its crew. The journey into the River Styx was meant to be a bold assertion of the Haralders’ unyielding spirit, yet it ended in silence and mystery.</font>

<font face='Acadian Runes' color='#dbdbdb' size='4'><b>The Drowning of Chieftains</b></font>
<font face='Acadian Runes' color='#dbdbdb'>At first, the Haralders sought to understand, thinking perhaps some natural force had claimed their ship. But as time wore on, other strange things began to happen. The sea itself seemed to stir in unrest, and the Haralders' leaders, once proud to call themselves "chieftains of the sea," began to meet untimely and inexplicable deaths. One after another, each "chieftain of the sea" drowned under mysterious circumstances, their bodies pulled from the waves without explanation. As each leader perished, the Haralders began to suspect the unthinkable—that the Firebarge’s journey into the Styx had awakened something far darker than they could have known.

And thus, suspicion began to fester. The Reavers, it was said, claimed no involvement in the curse. They insisted that it was the will of the Sister herself, that the Haralders had dared to trespass in a realm where mortal men had no place. But as the Haralders' leaders continued to fall, the whispers grew louder. The Reavers, some said, must have been behind it all, that the curse was a punishment for the Haralders’ arrogance. But the Reavers themselves remained silent, steadfast in their claim that it was the Sister’s wrath, not their hand, that had claimed the sailors and their ship.

The truth, however, remains a mystery. Was it the Reavers who had somehow invoked the curse, or was it the Sister herself, responding to the Haralders’ defiance? No one knows for sure. But what is certain is that the curse took hold, and the Haralders were left broken, leaving our people unable to travel the sea.</font>

<font face='Acadian Runes' color='#dbdbdb'>This revelation shattered the fragile peace between Clan Harald and Clan Reaver. What had once been rivalry over trade and influence became a bitter and bloody conflict. The Haralders, proud and furious, sought revenge for the curse. The Reavers, unrepentant and steadfast in their belief, saw the Sister’s actions as justified—punishment for the arrogance of Clan Harald.

The River Styx was, after all, the domain of the Sister; not a mortal gift to be claimed by those who did not honor her. Whether their curse was the Sister or the work of Clan Reaver, it has cast lasting shadows over all of us.

The rivalry between Clan Harald and Clan Reaver will never end. Each Clan sees the other as a threat, a competitor for control of the waters and the riches that flow through them. But in the end, both are bound to the same family. Though bitterness may remain between them, they must accept that their destinies are forever entwined.</font>
