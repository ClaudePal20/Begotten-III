<font color='#000' size='4'><b>Birth of the North</b></font>
<i>"With conviction I shall say this to my last breath, we are a kind to hate. Anathema to your sordid lot, I shall carry the weight of a burden divine. Your deceit will be cast aside, as I vow to expose it with mine righteous hand! Sol as my resolve, the Iron Gate of the Glaze shall stand!"</i>
— Saint Ragnar Odwyn

Hard-Glaze historians and literary geniuses of that sort have found it hard to place when exactly Ragnar Odwyn was born or where exactly he originated from, but it is widely accepted that he was a Gay-Gore of Northern stock, a warrior of a barbarous and savage ideal. When Lord Maximus came upon the Gores, mere barbarians in the Deadlands of Canada, and the fragmented tribes and villages that made its whole in the aftermath of the Holy Hierarchy Wars, it is believed that Ragnar was one of the chieftains who stood against him and knelt when his kind were shattered. It was then he, Ragnar, perceived Maximus as the highest ideal, a God in living flesh, and equated him to the nascent belief at the time - that he embodied the Father made flesh, a monster of war given skin and bone. He so decreed he would follow him into the jaws of death itself, and was planted Hard-Glaze forevermore.

<i>"Know that the eternal glory of the Glaze, its beauty and its simplicity, its truth and its power, has come to this place forever. The Light has smothered out the puke of putrid belief we brothers and sisters once believed in, and it has laid the foundations of a greater whole. Do not kneel before delusion, kneel before this elite fucking power."</i>
— Saint Ragnar Odwyn

It is said that after Ragnar Odwyn had unified the tribes of spearfolk around his home underneath the greater banner of the Glaze he had knelt to, that he had changed them so fundamentally. They became zealous, rabid and loyal to Maximus and He alone. They fought entirely for righteousness now, no longer for love of slaughter and looting. His people, the bastard union, huddled in squalid hamlets and tiny villages in the frigid cold among the border. They eked out meager returns of grain and led packs of sheep and cattle in the hills. They were shepherds and farmers.

Maximus had called upon the men of the North a handful of times and one of them was to deal with a great menace to the East that had cropped up. Ragnar dispatched fyrds of men, aided by local elders and ealdormen, to dispatch the Blackhat Menace. The Amish Wars lasted only a few months as the men of Gore-Glazic blood removed and burned the lands of the Blackhat, turning entire villages to little more than rubble and smoke. The black-hats were completely eradicated by the shepherds and peasants.

<i>"The insidious will never triumph, for their strength is that of weakness. They deceive and gird their words in flowery prose and majestic enunciation. To the simple spearfolk, their words and banter mean little as we crack their skulls open like watermelons, and cast their ichor upon the soil. Their mewls mattered little."</i>
— Saint Ragnar Odwyn

<font color='#000' size='4'><b>End of the Era</b></font>
<i>"There is no love for them left in me, for they are not my people. They have my blood, but not my faith. They crack rocks on bone and stoke weak fires and claim to be masters. They are nothing."</i>
— Saint Ragnar Odwyn

When war came once more the zealous and loyal Northlanders picked up their blades and spears, their bats and nooses and muskets. They marched at the bidding of the First Citizen, for he called for their action in slaughter. They racked the powder and gathered their arsenals, and set out on horseback and on foot. And when Maximus' set forth to lay holy waste to the Great Tree of the Gay menace, the Gore-Glazic rode out to reave the countryside. They brought war to the small places while Maximus brought the war to their heart. It is here where Ragnar would reave and set a terrible name for himself among the local Gores of what would one day be the Hill of Light. He broke their backs upon his knee, and shattered their meager warhosts with his great pressgang of shepherds and farmers. Peasants they were, they stood against the disgusting giants of the woods, and with sheer numbers they brought victory.

But not all was well. Ragnar found himself mortally wounded near the end of his campaign in the low places, and was set upon by a nameless Gay Chief. There, the Chief told him to beg for his life.

<i>"You putrid oaf... I refuse to conform to what you think you may see in me. I shall not surrender who I truly am."</i>

With the swing of a wicked axe, Ragnar's belly was split wide and he died on the field of battle. His men carried the victory, and his funeral was a vigil held for seven days and seven nights. No such great native leader of the Gore-Glaze would arise until generations later, under the purview of Saint Matheus when the Gore-Glazic people would be put to their breaking point.

<font color='#000' size='4'><b>Start of the Great Northern Architect</b></font>
<i>"We stand in one of the last remaining gardens on Gaia, a veritable Eden of proportions not unlike those of the days of the Empire. Yet long ago here, in the North, has arisen a sinister creed - one of misbegotten hatred of our people, cast upon us by savages! When the darkness descends, they will be smothered and lost - oh, Lord and Father Maximus, the great dark will not be our end. When the world falls into the end of days, we will rise again like a bright star."</i>
— Saint Matheus the Bald

In the frigid cold of the Hill of Light, there was the venerable Saint Matheus the Bald. Born Jeremiah Matheus, a man of pure Philimonjio blood amongst the North folk, he had risen through the ranks of the Low Ministry following his induction in his youth. He cleft through the heathens in the outlying villages, tidying the blemishes against the faith that had managed to find their way into the flock in the earlier years. They came during a time of collapse and sin, when pain was the commonmost, and there seemed no end and no hope.

By Matheus’ own holy hand he restored hope and prevented a great collapse, bringing strength to the Gay-Gores again. He bid them to build great walls and fortifications, and for his actions he was made High Priest.

<i>"It is cold here among the sticks and reeds. The woods are dark and filled with wicked things; yet the Hill stands defiant in the face of the end."</i>
— Saint Matheus The Bald

<font color='#000' size='4'><b>Bounty Before Them</b></font>
<i>“Know sanctuary, for it is all you will find here. Know compassion, for it is all I will show you. Know peace, for it is what I promise to render unto you. Know the Light, for it is truth and glory.”</i>
—  Saint Matheus the Bald 

It is well known the hatred that Matheus had of the Gay Gore. That justified and well-harbored dislike, mistrust and disregarding nature he held against them. For they knew nothing but treachery and barbarism, pillaging the outlying villages for all they were worth. The hordes of Shagalaxian barbarians, their Chieftains unnamed and rightfully forgotten, had forced the many shepherds and hunters from their unwalled hamlets into the Hill of Light.

A burgeoning population meant many more mouths to feed and with the granaries empty, Matheus spoke on behalf of the Cardinal: “Let the lands be for us all, and the Glaze’s bounty be made so that all may partake in its hallowed splendor.” And so the hunters reaved the forests and brought back bodies of elk and bear, and fed the many hungry that dwelt within.

What few outlying hamlets still supplied grain to the Hill, paying their tithe in hundredweights of flour and barley or in bodies upon bodies of fighting men. But, even with what seemed order and peace restored, came killers with fiery hatred.

Led by a Shagalaxian King, the many native clans of Gores marched upon the few who stood.

<font color='#000' size='4'><b>Fire and Smoke</b></font>
<i>“Oh, ye old and wicked sons of Heaven's lost! Stand in awe and raise your inverted cross! For you, kings of the earth, with your words of iron, you should have served his Holiness that you have so ruefully dismissed. Stand before your final day, and I rejoice in that I may watch you choke on every line you pray! Spit out your wretched words, but know they will be your last!”</i>
—  Saint Matheus the Bald 

And so Matheus’ hatred was brought to bear, for he had to draw his blade and rouse the fyrds. A horde of men wreathed in bleached iron and steel, with muskets full of powder and guns full of pop-a-shot, were followed by smoke-belching iron leviathans that crunched plants and man alike under their iron treads. They came for the Hill, and all that dwelt within.

They burnt through the hamlets and the villages, and in their wake a horde of refugees found sanctuary behind high walls. They huddled and cried when the Gay-Gores came, as the hird stood defiant in the face of great destruction. They roared with voice and with horn, banging shields with swords and casting out their defamation and damnation from the top of the Walls.

All know that Matheus stood upon the ramparts, and he let loose a furious bellow.
<i>“Let not a single of them live! Let not a single one draw another breath near our home! Defend your families, shake your spears and rattle your shields! Take to the hills, and rend them apart!”</i>

And so they did, roaring out from the Hill with furious abandon. The iron treads were stalled by corpses and logs, the Shagalaxian armor was bent and broken by furious peasants, and their ammo soon fell empty as only yet more poured out from behind their great concrete walls.

<i>“Oh, know me as I have died, not as I lived. I am but a man, simple man. My ichor drains just like any other, my blood spills and wets the soil. Know that even a holy man may die.”</i>
—  Saint Matheus the Bald 

While Goreic leviathans lay destroyed, their spearfolk army smashed and slain by furious peasants, there were many dead Gore-Glaze as payment. Strewn across the whole of a corpse field that would bloom into a tradition, to bury the newly dead among the original dead, to commemorate the battle that saw the Hill of Light saved.

Matheus, much like Ragnar before him, was felled in battle. Unlike Ragnar, Matheus still drew breath and the many local physicians tried their best to heal him back to health. And yet he bid them stop, and told them to bury him in the woods.


<font color='#000' size='4'><b>Consecration of Dust</b></font>
<i>“There was no greater man than Ragnar, who made us. But there was his equal, Matheus, who bound us back together under the Light. He brought hope when there was none.”</i>
—  Master-at-Arms Yeshua Torrention II, then High Emissary 

Another seven day and seven night vigil, and Matheus was laid to rest in a tomb outside of the Church he had consecrated, which now lay destroyed, his body still dwelling near.

His last words were spoken to the men around him shortly before his death.

<i>“I know the Light within you is burning dim, brother. The pain that resides within you. It saddens me to see you blinded by your suffering. I too succumb to darkness and despair. It feels like misery is where I belong. Despite this, I find myself questioning why I continue to make this effort. I don't understand why you deny the truth that all of us will die, one day. The difference is what a man does before they perish, the change they bring upon this broken world.”</i>

Upon the bed of death I look in wonder at this terrible event, and beheld a white mist, and seated within an iron throne was one like a son of man, with a golden crown on his head, and the wrath of humanity in his hand.

His eyes are like a flame of fire, and on his head was the golden crown of hope, his hands wielded a blade of awesome power, rifting apart heretic and evil alike!

Book_Treachery1 = [[
My Lords, I scribble these notes in desperation. I cry thee for heedance in these times of treachery. I am but a humble Emissary of the Light, and I report that mine Sanctuary has fallen. It was not from Gores, no Spearfolk breached these walls. Indeed I report uprising of lowborn making.

If this note is to fall into hands of Philimonjios creed, I urge ye to copy these letters and spread them to all Southern men still breathing. Beware, beware the Great Northern Orthodoxy! Madness hath taken them, they hear not our demands of fealty. For in the frigid North they fester, blood of Gore Kin. From the woods they stalk and chant their hymns and curses. Put them to the sword, I beg ye!

It started slow, like a growing fern. From the famine that hath ensued following bad harvest, their preachings took root. Their cursed church, I believe, was deep in a flooded canal close to the town square. I heard them cry out to Sol to worsen their condition, for they begged for further sufferings. We did not see them a threat to our Ministry, they were indeed more inclined to turn their blades against themselves. That was until the man with the Golden Face made his presence known.

The Golden Faced Prophet enchanted his followers with a desire for murder and thievery. With his own words he claimed his Sol valued Gold above Blood. He stated a Great Debt of Atonement must be repaid in full, through Blood and Gold each penny and heart shall be ripped from the wealthy until Sol shines again. Then he set his wretches upon the castle, and by Glaze I still yet weep at the memory.

The Sanctuary I was sworn to protect is no more. The halls have been ransacked, the stores pillaged, and all that remains are the corpses of the fallen. The Gate has been breached, the walls brought low, and the Thralls are soon to roam the bloodied streets. I still live but only by mine own cowardice. That is why I pen these words, for as witness I at least spread truth of their deeds. This night I shall plunge a dagger deep into mine neck, for it is my duty as Emissary to execute deserters.
